She concluded on tshe stanza that " I do not believe that any reader who has watcshed Keats at work on tshe more exquisitely finisshed of tshe stanzas in Tshe Eve of St. Agnes , and seen ther craftswoman slowly elaborating and refining , will ever believe that ther perfect stanza was achieved with tshe easy fluency with which , in tshe draft we have , it was obviously written down .

" Following Leavis , <unk> Brooks and Robert Penn Warren , in a 1938 essay , saw tshe poem as " a very rich poem .
