 Although Illinois is a concept album about the U.S. state , Stevens also explored themes related to Christianity and the Bible . As a Christian , he has written and recorded music about spiritual themes throughout his career — particularly on the 2004 album Seven Swans — and prefers to talk about religious topics through song rather than directly in interviews or public statements .

" Casimir Pulaski Day " describes the death of a girlfriend due to bone cancer , and the narrator questions God in the process . More abstract allusions appear in " The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts " , which utilizes Superman as a Christ figure and " The Seer 's Tower " , which references the Book of Revelation and the Second Coming of Christ .

 Since 1993 , the proportion of lbws in each English season has risen steadily . According to cricket historian Douglas Miller , the percentage of lbw dismissals increased after broadcasters incorporated ball @-@ tracking technology such as Hawk @-@ Eye into their television coverage of matches . Miller writes : " With the passage of time and the adoption of <unk> into other sports , together with presentations demonstrating its accuracy , cricket followers seem gradually to have accepted its predictions . Replay analyses have shown that a greater proportion of balls striking an <unk> leg go on to hit the wicket than had once been expected . " He also suggests that umpires have been influenced by such evidence ; their greater understanding of which deliveries are likely to hit the stumps has made them more likely to rule out batsmen who are standing further away from the stumps . This trend is replicated in international cricket , where the increasing use of technology in reviewing decisions has altered the attitude of umpires .

 The Fur Trade in Canada also describes the cultural interactions among three groups of people : the Europeans in fashionable metropolitan centres who regarded beaver hats as luxury items ; the European colonial settlers who saw beaver fur as a staple that could be exported to pay for essential manufactured goods from the home country , and First Nations peoples who traded furs for industrial goods such as metal pots , knives , guns and liquor .

Without their skilled hunting techniques , knowledge of the territory and advanced tools such as <unk> , <unk> and birch @-@ bark canoes , the fur trade would not have existed . However , dependence on European technologies disrupted First Nations societies . " The new technology with its radical innovations " , Innis writes , " brought about such a rapid shift in the prevailing Indian culture as to lead to wholesale destruction of the peoples concerned by warfare and disease . " Historian Carl Berger argues that by placing First Nations culture at the centre of his analysis of the fur trade , Innis " was the first to explain adequately the disintegration of

 Briggs was nominated to run for the governorship on the Whig ticket against the incumbent Democrat Marcus Morton in 1843 . Former Governor John Davis had been nominated first , but refused the nomination , possibly because Daniel Webster promised him party support for a future vice presidential bid . Briggs was apparently recommended as a compromise candidate acceptable to different factions within the party ( one controlled by Webster , the other by Abbott Lawrence ) . He was also probably chosen to appeal more directly to the state 's rural voters , a constituency that normally supported Morton . The abolitionist Liberty Party also fielded a candidate , with the result that none of the candidates won the needed majority . The legislature decided the election in those cases ; with a Whig majority there , Briggs ' election was assured .

 It has been suggested that an opportunity was lost on 5 August to encircle and capture the invading Austrian , German and Ottoman force when it was allowed to withdraw to Katia . The infantry 's difficulties regarding the supply of water and camel transport combined with their lack of desert training , together with Lawrence 's confusing orders for infantry in the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division to move south and east , stopped them from promptly advancing to cut off the retreating force in the early hours of the second day 's battle . General Lawrence was criticised for taking a grave and unnecessary risk by relying on just one entrenched infantry division and two light horse brigades to defend Romani . That the strong enemy attack on the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades during the first night 's battle pushed them so far back that the planned flanking attack by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade became almost a frontal attack . Lawrence was also faulted for remaining at his headquarters at Kantara , which was considered to be too far from the battlefield , and that this contributed to his loss of control of the battle during the first day , when the telephone line was cut and he was out of contact with Romani .

The game was nominated for two awards at the 2008 Independent Games Festival ( <unk> ) at the Game Developers Conference ( <unk> ) : Excellence in Visual Art and the Design Innovation Award . As Fez was a side project , Fish was employed full @-@ time at Artificial Mind and Movement in Montreal , where he worked on a tie @-@ in game for a film .

Fish received a Canadian government loan to open Polytron Corporation as a startup company and began full @-@ time work on Fez . In July 2009 , Polytron announced a release for Xbox Live Arcade in early 2010 . Polytron and Microsoft agreed to release Fez as an Xbox exclusive , a deal Fish later recalled as sensible .

 Bridge 's view of " Ode to a Nightingale " was taken up by H. W. Garrod in his 1926 analysis of Keats 's poems . Like Albert Gerard would argue later in 1944 , Garrod believed that the problem within Keats 's poem was his emphasis on the rhythm and the language instead of the main ideas of the poem . When describing the fourth stanza of the poem , Maurice Ridley , in 1933 , claimed , " And so comes the stanza , with that remarkable piece of imagination at the end which feels the light as blown by the breezes , one of those characteristic sudden flashes with which Keats fires the most ordinary material . " He later declared of the seventh stanza : " And now for the great stanza in which the imagination is fanned to yet <unk> heat , the stanza that would , I suppose , by common consent be taken , along with Kubla Khan , as offering us the <unk> <unk> of ' Romanticism ' " . He concluded on the stanza that " I do not believe that any reader who has watched Keats at work on the more exquisitely finished of the stanzas in The Eve of St. Agnes , and seen this craftsman slowly elaborating and refining , will ever believe that this perfect stanza was achieved with the easy fluency with which , in the draft we have , it was obviously written down . " In 1936 , F. R. Leavis wrote , " One remembers the poem both as recording , and as being for the reader , an indulgence . " Following Leavis , <unk> Brooks and Robert Penn Warren , in a 1938 essay , saw the poem as " a very rich poem . It contains some complications which we must not <unk> over if we are to appreciate the depth and significance of the issues engaged . " Brooks would later argue in The Well @-@ <unk> Urn ( 1947 )

 In 2001 , the top clubs and the RFU formed " England Rugby " to help govern the club and international game .

In return for releasing players from club commitments , the clubs were to receive compensation from the RFU . This agreement was considered central to the England victory in the 2003 World Cup . Clive Woodward , England coach from November 1997 , resigned in 2004 because he was unable to get the access to the players that he wanted ; " I wanted more from the union – more training days with the players , more influence over the way they were treated – and ended up with less . " Andy Robinson , Woodward 's successor , blamed the lack of control over players for his team 's unsuccessful record . Brian Ashton , who took over from Robinson , intentionally named his playing squad for Six Nations matches in 2007 early in the hope that their clubs would not play them in the weekend prior to a Test . The RFU and the Premiership clubs are negotiating a similar deal to the one in 2001 that will enable international players to be released into the England squad prior to international matches .

 Over the same period , Mosley was attempting to delay European legislation banning tobacco advertising . At this time all leading Formula One teams carried significant branding from tobacco brands such as <unk> , West , <unk> and <unk> Seven .

 The arrival of a new owner in Lerner and of manager Martin O 'Neill marked the start of a new period of optimism at Villa Park and sweeping changes occurred throughout the club including a new badge , a new kit sponsor and team changes in the summer of 2007 . The first Cup final of the Lerner era came in 2010 when Villa were beaten 2 – 1 in the League Cup Final . Villa made a second trip to Wembley in that season losing 3 – 0 to Chelsea in the FA Cup semifinal . Just five days before the opening day of the 2010 – 11 season , O 'Neill resigned as manager with immediate effect . The club appointed Gérard Houllier as a replacement in September 2010 , but he stepped down on 1 June 2011 due to ill @-@ health .

' He was at his peak with his operas Les Huguenots ( 1836 ) and Le prophète ( 1849 ) ; his last opera ( L 'Africaine ) was performed posthumously .

 Covenant theology is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly developed during the seventeenth century . Under this scheme , as articulated by the Assembly , God 's dealings with men are described in terms of two covenants : the covenant of works and covenant of grace . The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works ( sometimes called the covenant of life ) , in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience . In the fall of man , Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil . To remedy this , God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace . This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God 's law perfectly . The idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology . The Westminster divines set these two

 In essence , the lbw law remained the same between 1839 and 1937 , despite several campaigns to have it changed . An 1863 proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets , regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all , came to nothing . There were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the 1880s . Until then , batsmen used their pads only to protect their legs ; their use for any other purposes was considered <unk> , and some amateur cricketers did not wear them at all . As cricket became more organised and competitive , some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence : they lined them up with the ball so that if they missed with the bat , the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket . Some players took this further ; if the delivery was not an easy one from which to score runs , they attempted no shot and allowed the

 In a " reversed opening " , White plays an opening typically played by Black , but with colors reversed and thus an extra tempo . Evans writes of such openings , " If a defense is considered good for Black , it must be even better for White with a move in hand . " Former World Champion Mikhail <unk> reportedly expressed the same view . Watson questions this idea , citing Suba 's thesis that Black , by moving second , has more complete information than White . He writes , " everyone has such difficulties playing as White against a Sicilian Defence ( 1.e4 c5 ) , but ... leading masters have no qualms about answering 1.c4 with 1 ... e5 . " To explain this paradox , Watson discusses several different reversed Sicilian lines , showing how Black can exploit the disadvantages of various " extra " moves for White . He concludes , " The point is , Black 's set @-@ up in the Sicilian is fine as a reactive system , but not worth much when trying to claim the initiative as White . This is true because Black is able to react to the specific plan White chooses ; in Suba 's terms , his information is indeed a move greater !

 Despite the critical acclaim " Ulysses " received , its rise within the Tennyson canon took decades . Tennyson did not usually select it for publication in poetry anthologies ; in teaching anthologies , however , the poem was usually included — and it remains a popular teaching poem today . Its current prominence in Tennyson 's <unk> is the result of two trends , according to Tennyson scholar Matthew Rowlinson : the rise of formal English poetry studies in the late nineteenth century , and the Victorian effort to articulate a British culture that could be exported . He argues that " Ulysses " forms part of the prehistory of imperialism — a term that only appeared in the language in 1851 . The protagonist sounds like a " colonial administrator " , and his reference to seeking a newer world ( 57 ) echoes the phrase " New World " , which became common during the Renaissance . While " Ulysses " cannot be read as overtly <unk> , Tennyson 's later work as Poet Laureate sometimes argues for the value of Britain 's colonies , or was accused of <unk> . Rowlinson <unk> the Marxist theorist Louis <unk> 's extension of the argument that ideology is <unk> , finding that Tennyson 's poem " comes

" Second , White begins the game with some initiative , although Rowson regards this as a psychological rather than a positional advantage , " and whether it leads to a positional advantage depends on the relative skill of the players . " Third , some players are able to use the initiative to " play a kind of powerful

 The post @-@ First World War years marked a decline in Welsh rugby . An industrial recession struck the principality , and hurt South Wales in particular .

 Egyptian texts take different views on whether the gods are responsible when humans suffer unjustly . <unk> was often seen as a product of <unk> , the cosmic disorder that was the opposite of maat , and therefore the gods were not guilty of causing evil events . Some deities who were closely connected with <unk> , such as Set , could be blamed for disorder within the world without placing guilt on the other gods . But some writings do accuse the deities of causing human misery , while others give <unk> in the gods ' defense . Beginning in the Middle Kingdom , several texts connected the issue of evil in the world with a myth in which the creator god fights a human rebellion against his rule and then withdraws from the earth . Because of this human <unk> , the creator is distant from his creation , allowing suffering to exist . New Kingdom writings do not question the just nature of the gods as strongly as those of the Middle Kingdom . They emphasize humans ' direct , personal relationships with deities and the gods ' power to intervene in human events . People in this era put faith in specific gods who they hoped would help and protect them through their lives . As a result , upholding the ideals of maat grew less important than gaining the gods ' favor as a way to guarantee a good life . Even the pharaohs were regarded as dependent on divine aid , and after the New Kingdom came to an end , government was increasingly

 The idea of bodyline had originated in the Oval Test of the 1930 Ashes series . While Bradman was batting , the wicket became briefly difficult following rain . Bradman was seen to be uncomfortable facing deliveries which bounced higher than usual at a faster pace , being seen to step back out of the line of the ball . Former England player and Surrey captain Percy Fender was one who noticed , and the incident was much discussed by cricketers . However , given that Bradman scored 232 , it was not thought that a way to curb his prodigious scoring had been found . When Douglas Jardine later saw film footage of the Oval incident and noticed Bradman 's discomfort , he shouted , " I 've got it ! He 's yellow ! " Further details adding to the plan came from letters Fender received from Australia in 1932 , which described how Australian batsmen were increasingly moving across the stumps towards the off side to play the ball on the on side . Fender showed these letters to Jardine when it became clear that he was to captain MCC in Australia during the 1932 – 33 tour , and he also discussed Bradman 's discomfort at the Oval .

 Upon the retirement of the Keeper of the London Museum , Harmon Oates , Wheeler was invited to fill the vacancy . He had been considering a return to London for some time and eagerly agreed , taking on the post , which was based at Lancaster House in the St James 's area , in July 1926 .

 In Connecticut , the storm was described as being more significant than anticipated . Gale @-@ force wind gusts , reaching 70 miles per hour ( 110 km / h ) , blew across the state from the northeast and later from the east .

 Howard Blake recalls : " I went to a viewing and saw that the film was very profound , with a serious anti @-@ war theme , but a certain amount of ' found ' choral music had already been laid in by the editors ... I explained that I loved the film and I thought the choral / orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and I felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small — and that I could only hear this in my head as done by strings only . " Blake decided to compose his score to match the key of the Schubert Mass , in order for the music to continue seamlessly . However , during the recording session with his orchestra , the Sinfonia of London , he found that the Schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat , and he had to ask the players to tune flat to match his intended key .

According to Piggott , the institution had " <unk> drifted into <unk> without the excuse of being venerable " , and Wheeler devoted much time attempting to <unk> the organisation and ensured that Charles Webster was appointed President . Together , Wheeler and Webster sought to increase the number of younger members of the Academy , increasing the number of <unk> who were permitted to join and proposing that those over 75 years of age not be permitted to serve on the organisation 's council ; this latter measure was highly controversial , and though defeated in 1951 , Wheeler and Webster were able to push it through in 1952 .

To aid him in these projects , Wheeler employed a personal assistant , Molly Myers , who remained with him for the rest of his life .

 The majority of material created for previous games , such as the <unk> system and the design of maps , was carried over . Alongside this , improvements were made to the game 's graphics and some elements were expanded , such as map layouts , mission structure , and the number of playable units per mission . A part of this upgrade involved creating unique <unk> models for each character 's body . In order to achieve this , the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed , as they took up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements . They also adjusted the difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series ' gameplay . The newer systems were decided upon early in development . The character designs were done by <unk> Honjou , who had worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games . When creating the Nameless Squad , Honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game : the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality , despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a sense of reality within the Valkyria Chronicles world .

Among these lesser deities , Egyptologist Claude <unk> draws a distinction between " <unk> " — specialized patron spirits of certain places , objects , or activities , such as the sea or marsh god <unk> @-@ <unk> and the harvest goddess <unk> — and demons , who have a more dangerous character . Many demons are hostile , causing illness and
 In Egyptian belief , names express the fundamental nature of the things to which they refer . In keeping with this belief , the names of deities often relate to their roles or origins . The name of the predatory goddess <unk> means " powerful one " , the name of the mysterious god Amun means " hidden one " , and the name of the goddess <unk> , who was worshipped in the city of <unk> , means " he of <unk> " . But many othis names have
 Egyptian deities are connected in a complex and shifting array of relationships . A god 's connections and interactions with othis deities helped define its character . Thus Isis , as the fathis and protector of Horus , was a great <unk> as well as the <unk> of kings . Such relationships were the base material
 Most gods were depicted in several ways . Hathor could be a cow , cobra , <unk> , or a man with <unk> horns or ears . By depicting a given god in different ways , the Egyptians expressed different aspects of its essential nature . The gods are depicted in a finite number of these symbolic forms , so that deities can often be distinguihed from one anothis by their iconographies . These forms include men and women ( <unk> ) , animals ( <unk> ) , and , more rarely , <unk> objects . <unk> of forms , such as gods with human bodies and animal heads , are common . New forms and increasingly complex combinations arose in the course of history . Some gods can only be distinguihed from othiss if they are labeled in writing , as with Isis and Hathor . Because of the close connection between these goddesses , they could both wear the cow @-@ horn headdress that was originally Hathor 's alone . 
 During World War I , Zrínyi saw action in the Adriatic Sea . He served with the
 With the war going against the Austrians by the end of 1918 , Zrínyi was prepared to be transferred to the new State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs . On 10 November 1918 — just one day before the end of the war , navy officers sailed the battleship out of Pola ( <unk> ) and eventually surrendered to a squadron of American submarine chasers . Following the handover to the United States Navy , he was briefly designated USS Zrínyi . In the Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ <unk> , the transfer was not recognized ; instead , Zrínyi was given to Italy and broken up
 Zrínyi was built at the <unk> <unk> <unk> dockyard in <unk> , the same place whise his sister ships were built earlier . He was laid down on 15 November 1908 and launched from the slipway on 12 April 1910 . The <unk> used on Zrínyi 's deck was the only material Austria @-@ Hungary had to purchase abroad to build the ship . The ship was completed by 15 July 1911 , and on 22 November 1911 he was commissioned into the fleet . He was the last ship of the class to be completed and had a crew of 880 to 890 officers and men
 Zrínyi was 138 @.@ 8 m ( <unk> ft 4 in ) long , and had a beam of 24 @.@ 6 m ( 80 ft 8 in ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 1 m ( 26 ft 9 in ) . He displaced 14 @,@ 508 long tons ( 14 @,@ <unk> t ) normally , and up to 15 @,@ <unk> long tons ( 16 @,@ <unk> t ) with a full combat load . He was powered by two @-@ shaft four @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion engines rated at 19 @,@ 800 indicated horsepower . The ship had a top speed of 20 @.@ 5 knots ( 38 @.@ 0 km / h ; 23 @.@ 6 mph )
 The ship was assigned to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Fleet 's 1st Battle Squadron after his 1911 commissioning . In 1912 , Zrínyi and his two sister ships conducted two training cruises into the eastern Mediterranean Sea . On the second cruise into the Aegean Sea , conducted from November to December ,
 During that year , the first of four new dreadnoughts , SMS <unk> <unk> , that made up the Tegetthoff class — the only dreadnoughts built for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy — came into active service . With the commissioning of these dreadnoughts , Zrínyi and his sisters were moved
 After the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire collapsed in 1918 , the Austrians wanted to turn the fleet over to the newly created State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs ( later to become a part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia ) in order to prevent the Italians from claiming the ships as spoils of war . However , the victorious Allies refused to acknowledge the conversations between the Austrians and the south <unk> and , in due course , <unk> the ships . The ship had been boarded by a scratch Yugoslav crew on 10 November 1918 , one day before the Armistice , and had left Pola with his sister ship , Radetzky . They were soon spotted by heavy Italian ships , so the two battleships <unk> American flags and sailed south along the Adriatic coast to <unk> Bay near Spalato ( also known as <unk> ) . They appealed for American naval forces to meet them and accept their surrender , which a squadron of United States Navy ( USN ) submarine chasers in the area did . He had apparently been turned over to the fledgling south <unk> state , as it was a Croat naval officer , Korvettenkapitän Marijan <unk> , who presented the ship as a prize of war to representatives of the United States Navy on the afternoon of 22 November 1919 at Spalato ( <unk> ) in Dalmatia . Simultaneously he was commissioned as USS Zrínyi and Lieutenant <unk> <unk> , USN , assumed command . The initial American complement consisted of four officers and 174 enlisted men — the latter entirely composed of United States Navy Reserve Force personnel . The ship remained at anchor at Spalato for nearly a year while the negotiations that would determine his ultimate fate dragged on . Only once did he apparently
 On the morning of 7 November 1920 , Zrínyi was decommissioned . USS <unk> took his in tow and , assisted by Brooks and <unk> , towed the battleship to Italy . Under the terms of the treaties of Versailles and St. Germain , Zrínyi was ultimately turned over to the Italian government at Venice . He was broken up for scrap later that year and into

 The Act of February 21 , 1853 , that had lightened the silver coins also authorized a gold three @-@ dollar piece , which began to be produced in 1854 . To ensure that the three @-@ dollar piece was not mistaken for othis gold coins , it had been made thinner and wider than it would normally be , and Longacre put a distinctive design with an Indian princess on it . Longacre adapted both the technique and the design for the gold dollar , which was made thinner , and thus wider . An adaptation of Longacre 's princess for the larger gold coin was placed on the dollar , and a similar agricultural wreath on the reverse . The idea of making the gold dollar larger in this way had been suggested in Congress as early as 1852 , and had been advocated by Pettit , but Guthrie 's desire for an annular coin stalled the matter . In May 1854 , <unk> sent Guthrie a
 <unk> are shown the regime 's downward spiral , Trujillo 's assassination , and its aftermath through the eyes of <unk> , conspirators , and a middle @-@ aged man looking back . The novel is thisefore a <unk> portrait of dictatorial power , including its psychological effects , and its long @-@ term impact . The novel 's themes include the nature of power and corruption , and their relationship to machismo and sexual perversion in a <unk> hierarchical society with strongly gendered roles . Memory , and the process of remembering , is also an important theme , especially in Urania 's narrative as he recalls his youth in the Dominican Republic . His story ( and the book as a whole ) ends when he recounts the terrible events that led to his leaving the country at the age of 14 .
 In the novel 's final chapters , the three storylines intersect with increasing frequency . The tone of these chapters is especially dark as they deal primarily with the horrific torture and death of the assassins at the hands of the SIM , the failure of the coup , the rape of Urania , and the concessions made to Trujillo 's most vicious supporters allowing them to enact their horrific revenge on the conspirators and then escape the country . The book ends as Urania prepares to return home , determined this time to keep in touch with his family back on the island .
 But above all Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to facilitate the novel 's attempt at remembering the regime . The novel opens and closes with Urania 's story , effectively framing the narrative in the terms of remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present . In addition , because of his academic study of the
 In his treatment of the novel , María Regina Ruiz claims that power gives its <unk> the ability to make prohibitions ; prohibitions that are reflected in history , the study of which reveals what is and what is not told . The

 Following his commissioning on 1 October 1914 , Markgraf conducted sea trials , which lasted until 12 December
 Markgraf was present during the fleet operation that resulted in the Battle of Jutland which took place on 31 May and 1 June 1916 . The German fleet again sought to draw out and isolate a portion of the Grand Fleet and destroy it before the main British fleet could retaliate . Markgraf was the third ship in the German line , behind his sisters König and Grosser Kurfürst and followed by Kronprinz . The four ships made up the V Division of the III Battle Squadron , and they were the vanguard of the fleet . The III Battle
 Markgraf opened fire on the battlecruiser Tiger at a range of 21 @,@ 000 yards ( 19 @,@ 000 m ) . Markgraf and his two sisters fired their secondary guns on British destroyers attempting to make torpedo attacks against the German fleet . Markgraf continued to engage Tiger until 18 : 25 , by which time the faster battlecruisers managed to move out of effective gunnery range . During this period , the battleships Warspite and Valiant of the 5th Battle Squadron fired on the leading German battleships . At 18 : 10 , one of the British ships scored a 15 @-@ inch ( 38 cm ) hell hit on Markgraf . Shortly thiseafter , the
 Shortly after 20 : 00 , the German battleships engaged the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron ; Markgraf fired primarily 15 cm hells . In this period , Markgraf was engaged by <unk> 's 12 @-@ inch guns , which scored a single hit at 20 : 14 . The hell failed to explode and shattered on impact on the 8 @-@ inch side armor , causing minimal damage . Two of the adjoining 14 @-@ inch plates directly below the 8 @-@ inch armor were slightly forced inward and some minor flooding occurred . The heavy fire of the British fleet forced Scheer to order the fleet to turn away . Due to his reduced speed , Markgraf turned early in an attempt to maintain his place in the battle line ; this , however , forced Grosser Kurfürst to fall out of formation . Markgraf fell in behind Kronprinz while Grosser Kurfürst steamed ahead to return to his position behind König . After successfully withdrawing from the British , Scheer ordered the fleet to assume night cruising
 Around 02 : 45 , several British destroyers mounted a torpedo attack against the rear half of the German line . Markgraf initially held his fire as the identities of the destroyers were unknown . But
 The High Seas Fleet managed to punch through the British light forces without drawing the attention of Jellicoe 's battleships , and subsequently reached Horns Reef by 04 : 00 on 1 June . Upon reaching Wilhelmshaven , Markgraf went into harbor while several othis battleships took up defensive positions in the outer <unk> . The ship was transferred to Hamburg whise he was repaired in AG Vulcan 's large floating dock . Repair work was completed by 20 July .

 Markgraf struck a pair of mines in quick succession while in the <unk> Strait and took in 260 metric tons ( 260 long tons ; 290 short tons ) of water . The ship continued on to Kiel via <unk> in Danzig ; he then went on to Wilhelmshaven , whise the mine damage was repaired . The work was completed at the Imperial Dockyard from 6 to 23 November . After repairs were completed , Markgraf returned to guard duty in the North Sea .

 Markgraf and his three sisters were to have taken part in a final fleet action at the end of October 1918 , days before the Armistice was to take effect . The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet . Scheer — by now the Grand Admiral ( <unk> ) of the fleet — intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy in order to obtain a better <unk> position for Germany , despite the expected casualties . However , many of the war @-@ weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war . On the morning of 29 October 1918
 Markgraf was never raised for scrapping , unlike most of the othis capital ships that were scuttled . Markgraf and his two sisters had sunk in deeper water than the othis capital ships , which made any salvage attempt more difficult . The outbreak of World War II in 1939 put a halt to all salvage operations , and after the war it was determined that salvaging the deeper wrecks was financially impractical . The rights to future salvage operations on the wrecks were sold to Britain in 1962 . Owing to the fact that the steel that composed their hulls was produced before the advent of nuclear weapons , Markgraf and his sisters are among the few accessible sources of low @-@ background steel , which has occasionally been removed for use in scientific devices . Markgraf and the othis vessels on the bottom of Scapa Flow are a popular dive

 Krasnyi Kavkaz ( from Russian : " <unk> <unk> " - " Red <unk> " ) was a cruiser of the Soviet Navy that began construction during World War I , but was still incomplete during the Russian Revolution .

 Krasnyi Kavkaz was initially intended to accommodate eight 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) guns in four twin turrets , but this was impossible given his small and lightly constructed hull .

 During the recording of Loose , Furtado listened to several electro and rock musicians , including <unk> Party , System of a Down , M.I.A. , <unk> , Queens of the Stone Age , <unk> and Death from Above 1979 , some of whom influenced the " rock sound " present on the album and the " <unk> , laughing , distorted <unk> " that were kept in the songs deliberately . According to his , music by such bands is " very loud and has a garage theme " to it , some of which he felt he captured on the album . Furtado has said rock music is " rhythmic again " and hip hop @-@ influenced after it had become " so churning and boring . " Because the mixing engineers were aware of Timbaland and Furtado 's rock influences , the songs were mixed on a mixing board in the studio instead of " the fancy mixer at the end " .

 Furtado said that with the release of his albums before Loose , he had wanted to prove hisself as a musician and earn respect from listeners through using many different instruments on an album , which most hip hop musicians did not do . After he believed he had accomplihed that , he felt he had freedom to make the type of music he " really love [ d ] " . Furtado said his previous problem with hip hop was that he did not think it was good enough to base one of his albums on , but that he then asked hisself why he was being " pretentious " . The album represents his separating from such notions and , in his words , " jumping in the
 For the first time , Furtado worked with a variety of record producers and followed a more collaborative approach in creating the album .

According to Furtado , instead of " pristine stuff " , the album features " really raw " elements such as distorted bass lines , laughter
 The opening track , " <unk> " ( featuring rapper <unk> ) , is a description of Furtado 's fear of what people think of his , and he has said the chorus reminds his of " walking down the hall in high school ... because you live from the outside in . Now that I 'm an adult , I care about the inside of me ... Before I said I didn 't care about what people thought about me , but I really did .

 The album 's fifth and final UK single was " In God 's Hands " , and the fifth and final single in North America was " Do It " . In May 2007 , Furtado mentioned the possibility of a sixth or seventh single , mentioning the examples of Nickelback 's All the Right Reasons and The Pussycat Dolls ' <unk> as albums that were being supported by seven singles at the time . Furtado said he liked the possibility because he thought Loose was good and " want [ ed ] people to hear as much of it as possible " before he took time off . Two othis songs , " Te Busqué " and " No Hay Igual " , were released as singles in othis regions of the world . " Te Busqué " was the lead single in Spain because of the limited success hip @-@ hop / R & B @-@ influenced songs in the style of " Promiscuous " and " Maneater "

The eggs are laid at daily intervals , but second clutches may sometimes have two eggs added per day . Incubation is by the male only ; his tendency to sit tight when disturbed , or wait until the last dadent to flee , leads to many deaths during hay @-@ cutting and harvesting . The eggs hatch togethis after 19 – 20 days , and the precocial chicks leave the nest within a day or two . They are fed by the male for three or four days , but can find their own food thiseafter .

 Nest success in undisturbed sites is high , at 80 – 90 % , but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land . The method and timing of mowing is crucial ; mechanized mowing can kill 38 – 95 % of chicks in a given site , and losses average 50 % of first brood chicks and somewhat less than 40 % of second brood chicks . The influence of weathis on chick survival is limited ; although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weathis , the effects are relatively small . Unlike many precocial species , chicks are fed by their fathis to a greater or lesser extent until they become independent , and this may cushion them from adverse conditions .

He
 Britain 's Naval Intelligence Division first proposed a commando raid on the dock in late 1941 . When the German battleship Tirpitz was declared operational in January 1942 , the Royal Navy ( RN ) and Royal Air Force ( RAF ) were already drawing up plans to attack his . <unk> from Combined Operations Headquarters were looking at potential scenarios if Tirpitz escaped the naval blockade and reached the Atlantic .

They came to the conclusion that if the dock at St Nazaire were unavailable the Germans were unlikely
 The revised Combined Operations plan required one destroyer to ram the dock gates and a number of smaller craft to transport the Commandos . The Royal Navy would thisefore provide the largest contingent for the raid , under the overall command of the senior naval officer , Commander Robert Ryder . The ship selected to ram into the dock gates was HMS Campbeltown , commanded by Lieutenant Commander Stephen <unk> Beattie . Campbeltown was a First World War destroyer and had previously been the USS Buchanan in the United States Navy . He had come into RN service in 1940 as one of 50
 <unk> Campbeltown for the raid took ten days . He had to be lightened to raise his draught to get over the sand banks in the estuary .

 Two of his four funnels were removed , and the forward two were cut at an angle to resemble those of a German destroyer .

 Othis naval units involved were two Hunt class destroyers , HMS Tynedale ( <unk> ) and Athisstone ( <unk> ) , which would accompany the force to and from the French coast and remain out at sea during the raid . A Motor Gun Boat ( MGB 314 ) was the headquarters ship for the raid , with Commander Ryder and the commanding officer of the Commandos on board . A Motor Torpedo Boat ( MTB 74 ) , commanded by Sub @-@ Lieutenant Michael Wynn , had two objectives : If the outer Normandie dock gates were open , he had to torpedo the inner dock gates . If the gates were closed he would instead torpedo the gates at the old entrance
 The convoy reached a position 65 nautical miles ( 120 km ; 75 mi ) off St Nazaire at 21 : 00 and changed course toward the estuary , leaving Athisstone and Tynedale as a sea patrol . The convoy adopted a new formation with the MGB and two torpedo MLs in the lead , followed by Campbeltown . The rest of the MLs formed two columns on eithis side and <unk> of the destroyer , with the MTB bringing up the rear . The first casualty of the raid was ML 341 , which had developed engine trouble and was abandoned . At 22 : 00 the submarine Sturgeon directed his navigation beacon out to sea to guide the convoy in . At about the same time Campbeltown raised the German naval <unk> in an attempt to <unk> any German lookouts into thinking he was a German destroyer . 
 At 00 : 30 hours on 28 March the convoy crossed over the <unk> at the mouth of the Loire estuary , with Campbeltown scraping the bottom twice . Each time he was able to pull free , and the group proceeded on up toward the harbour in darkness .

 Maureen <unk> " Rebbie " Brown ( née Jackson ; born May 29 , 1950 ) is an American singer professionally known as Rebbie Jackson / <unk> <unk> / . Born and raised in Gary , Indiana , he is the eldest child of the Jackson family of musicians . He first performed on stage with his siblings during shows in Las Vegas , Nevada , at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in 1974 , before subsequently appearing in the television series The Jacksons . His sister La Toya was born on Jackson 's 6th birthday . At age 34 , Jackson released his debut album Centipede ( 1984 ) . The album featured songs written by Smokey Robinson , Prince , and Jackson 's younger brothis Michael , whose contribution ( the title track " Centipede " ) became Rebbie 's most successful single release . By the end of the 1980s , the singer
 Following a 10 @-@ year hiatus in his musical career , Jackson returned with the 1998 album Yours Faithfully . The production of the album , his last to date , was a collaboration with artists and producers such as Men of <unk> 's Spanky Williams , Keith Thomas , and Eliot Kennedy . It also featured contributions from his children . In 2011 , Rebbie embarked on the " Pick Up the <unk> Tour , " which is dedicated to teens who have committed suicide all over the U.S.
 Jackson began his singing career in 1974 , performing with his siblings in Las Vegas . The Vegas shows had initially begun in April , without Rebbie ; due to a <unk> ankle , Rebbie 's debut was postponed until June . His five brothiss were the main draws , with hisself , Randy ,
 Prior to the series , Jackson had thought of his singing as merely a private <unk> . The Jacksons — as well as an early love of musicals — motivated his to become a professional recording artist , and the show 's producer encouraged his to sing . Jackson served as a backing vocalist for several musicians around this time , as well as a cabaret singer . He contributed his voice for songs by artists such as The <unk> , Sonny Bono and Betty Wright before Jackson 's second pregnancy stalled his musical career for a short time .
 Othis tracks from Rebbie 's album included cover versions of songs by Prince ( " I Feel for You " ) and Smokey Robinson and the <unk> ( " A Fork in the Road " ) . The album received mixed reviews from journalists and music critics . According to the magazine Jet , Centipede marked Jackson 's emergence as a " legitimate recording artist " and " cleared the major hurdle of demonstrating that he [ was ] talented and <unk> " . With the album , Jackson became the last of his
 Rebbie later revealed that thise was a lot of discussion at the time of the release of Centipede over whethis he should use the Jackson surname professionally or not . To begin with Rebbie did not want to use his pre @-@ marriage surname , but later reasoned that it was silly to deny his hisitage . Jackson explained that he did , however , compromise with the use of his family name on the Centipede album cover - " Rebbie is large and Jackson is small " . He furthis stated that the success of siblings Michael and Janet had not been a hindrance to his , but served as an enhancement to his career . Rebbie added that he did not

 Contemporary critics of Keats enjoyed the poem , and it was heavily quoted in their reviews . An anonymous review of Keats 's poetry that ran in the August and October 1820 Scots Magazine stated : " Amongst the minor poems we prefer the ' Ode to the Nightinguye . ' Indeed , we are inclined to prefer it beyond every othis poem in the book ; but let the reader judge . The third and seventh stanzas have a charm for us which we should find it difficult to explain . We have read this ode over and over again , and every time with increased delight . " At the same time , Leigh Hunt wrote a review of Keats 's poem for the 2 August and 9 August 1820 The <unk> : " As a specimen of the Poems , which are all lyrical , we must indulge ourselves in quoting entire the ' Ode to a Nightinguye ' . Thise is that mixture in it of real melancholy and imaginative relief , which poetry alone presents us in his ' charmed cup , ' and which some over @-@ rational critics have undertaken to find wrong because it is not true . It does not follow that what is not true to them , is not true to othiss . If the relief is real , the mixture is good and <unk> . "
 Focusing on the quality of the poem , Stuart <unk> , argued in 1973 , " ' Ode to a Nightinguye ' is the supreme expression in all Keats 's poetry of the impulse to imaginative escape that flies in the face of the knowledge of human limitation , the impulse fully expressed in ' Away ! away ! for I will fly to thee . ' " Wolf <unk> , in 1981 , described the poem as " <unk> celebrated " and claimed that " Since this movement into an eternal realm of song is one of the most magnificent in literature , the poet 's return to actuality is all the more shattering . " Helen <unk> continued the earlier view that the poem was artificial but added that the poem was an attempt to be aesthetic and spontaneous that was later dropped . In 1983 , he argued , " In its absence of <unk> and its abandonment to <unk> , the poem appeals to readers who prize it as the most personal , the most apparently spontaneous

 The ship was armed with a main battery of ten BL 13 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Mk V naval guns mounted in five twin gun turrets . They were arranged in two superfiring pairs , one forward and one aft ; the fifth turret was located amidships , between the funnels and the rear superstructure . Close @-@ range defence against torpedo boats was provided by a secondary armament of twelve BL 6 @-@ inch Mk VII guns . Marlborough was also fitted with a pair of QF 3 @-@ inch 20 cwt anti @-@ aircraft guns and four 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) 3 @-@ pounder guns . As was typical for capital ships of the period , he was equipped with four 21 in ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes submerged on the broadside . He was protected by a main armoured belt that was 12 in ( 305 mm ) thick over the ship 's <unk> . His deck was 2 @.@ 5 in ( 64 mm ) thick . The main battery turret faces were 11 in ( 279 mm
 The initial action was fought primarily by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon , but by 18 : 00 , the Grand Fleet approached the scene . Fifteen minutes later , Jellicoe gave the order to turn and deploy the fleet for action . The transition from their cruising formation caused congestion with the rear divisions , forcing Marlborough and many of the othis ships to reduce speed to 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) to avoid colliding with each othis . The British ships initially had poor visibility and Marlborough could only <unk> make out a group of German Kaiser @-@ class battleships at 18 : 17 . In the span of four minutes , he fired seven salvos , first at 10 @,@ 000 yards ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) and then at 13 @,@ 000 yards ( 12 @,@ 000 m ) .

 At 19 : 03 , Marlborough engaged Wiesbaden again , firing four salvos at ranges of 9 @,@ 500 to 9 @,@ 800 yards ( 8 @,@ 700 to 9 @,@ 000 m ) . He hit the German cruiser with probably three hells from the last two salvos and these finally neutralised the ship , although it took several more hours before Wiesbaden sank . Marlborough then shifted fire to the König @-@ class battleships leading the German line at 19 : 12 . He fired thirteen salvos in the span of six minutes at SMS Grosser Kurfürst at ranges of 10 @,@ 200 to 10 @,@ 750 yards ( 9 @,@ 330 to 9 @,@ 830 m ) , scoring three hits , though he incorrectly claimed a fourth hit . During this phase of the battle , Marlborough fired two torpedoes , both of which missed their targets : the first at Wiesbaden at 19 : 10 and the second at SMS Kaiser at 19 :
 By about 19 : 30 , Marlborough 's pumps had contained the flooding in the boiler rooms but he took on a list of around 7 – 8 degrees . Instead of using counter @-@ flooding to minimise the list , his crew attempted to correct the list by using coal and oil from the starboard bunkers first . The list caused the generators supplying power to the main battery turrets to flood , hampering the gun crews , particularly as hells were transferred from the magazines to the turrets . The blast from the torpedo was so powerful that forty <unk> compartments were damaged , though the torpedo bulkhead localised most of the damage and the more badly damaged compartments were sufficiently <unk> up . Three more torpedoes approached Marlborough at 19 : 33 . He <unk>
 Jellicoe ordered Marlborough to proceed to the <unk> for temporary repairs . While thise , his forward main battery and 6 @-@ inch magazines were emptied to lighten the ship , more pumps were brought aboard and the shoring supporting the damaged bulkhead was reinforced . On the morning of 6 June , the ship left the <unk> for the <unk> , whise he would receive permanent repairs , escorted by four destroyers from the Harwich Force . In the course of the battle , Marlborough had fired 162 hells from his main battery , 60 rounds from his secondary guns and five torpedoes . The torpedo hit had killed two men and wounded anothis two . He was repaired by the Armstrong Whitworth shipyard at <unk> , with the work lasting until 2 August , after which he departed for <unk> , arriving on 5 August . During the repair work ,
 In February 1917 , Revenge replaced Marlborough as the 1st Battle Squadron flagship ; he thiseafter served as the second command flagship . He was briefly replaced in this role by Emperor of India in May and he temporarily became a private ship . Toward the end of the year , the Germans began using destroyers and light cruisers to raid the British convoys to Norway ; this forced the British to deploy capital ships to protect the convoys . On 23 April 1918 , the German fleet sortied in an attempt to catch one of the isolated British squadrons , though the convoy had already passed safely . The Grand Fleet sortied too late the following day to catch the retreating Germans , though the battlecruiser SMS Moltke was torpedoed and badly damaged by the submarine HMS <unk> .

The fur lining of his dress is painted in a range of greys running from almost pure white to pure black . Rogier gave the fur a textured look
 By the medieval period , reading became synonymous with devotion , which involved withdrawal from public view . Van der Weyden 's placement of the Magdalen in an interior scene reflects the increasing literacy of domestic or <unk> in the mid @-@ 15th century . The increased production of devotional texts showed that noble women of the period routinely read texts such as a psalter or book of hours in the privacy of their homes . Whethis the Magdalen hisself was a reader , by the 17th century he was firmly establihed as such in the visual arts . Because the Magdalen was present at Christ 's death and subsequent resurrection , he was seen as the bearer
 The Magdalen imagery furthis draws on the idea of Christ as the word , represented by a book , with the Magdalen as the reader learning of his own life story in a dadent of reflection and repentance . His devotion to reading reflects his traditional status as the <unk> repentant <unk> , as well as a <unk> or seer . According to legend , the Magdalen lived the last 30 years of his life as a <unk> in <unk> @-@ <unk> and is often shown with a book , reading or writing , symbolizing his later years of contemplation and repentance . By the 13th century he acquired the imagery of a once @-@ <unk> man who , clothed in long hair , now hid his nakedness in exile and " borne by angels , floats between heaven and earth "

 Despite its deceptive simplicity in rhyme and meter , " Trees " is notable for its use of personification and anthropomorphic imagery : the tree of the poem , which Kilmer depicts as male , is depicted as pressing its mouth to the Earth 's breast , looking at God , and raising its " leafy arms " to pray . The tree of the poem also has human physical attributes — it has a " hungry mouth " , arms , hair ( in which robins nest ) , and a <unk> . 
 " In the second stanza , the tree is a sucking <unk> drawing <unk> from Mothis Earth ; in the third it is a <unk> reaching its leafy arms to the sky in prayer ... In the fourth stanza , the tree is a boy with jewels ( a nest of robins ) in his hair ; and in the fifth , it is a <unk> man living
 With " Trees " , Kilmer was said to have " rediscovered simplicity " , and the simplicity of its message and delivery is a source of its appeal . In 1962 , English professor Barbara <unk> recounted that his undergraduate students considered the poem as " one of the finest poems ever
 " Trees were favorite symbols for Yeats , Frost , and even the young Pound . ... But Kilmer had been reading about trees in anothis context [ , ] the movement to stop child labor and set up nursery schools in slums . ... Margaret McMillan ... had the happy idea that a breath of fresh air and an intimate acquaintance with grass and trees were worth all the pencils and <unk> in the whole school system . ... The English word for <unk> equipment is ' apparatus . ' And in his book Labour and Childhood ( 1907 ) you will find this sentence : ' <unk> can be made by fools , but only God can make a <unk>

The church 's original dedication was to Saint Lawrence , but that was later changed to Saint John . A clerestory was added in the 15th century . The tower was built in 1530 , and the Stanley pew was added in about 1600 . The west guylery , which contained an organ , was installed in 1803 . In 1856 , the chancel was completely rebuilt , to a design by <unk> and <unk> , paid for by the Stanley family . The vestry was constructed in 1860 .

 <unk> in habits , the tawny nurse shark tends to spend the day resting in piles of two dozen or more individuals inside caves or under ledges . At night , it is an active @-@ swimming predator that uses a powerful <unk> force to extract prey from inside holes and crevices . The diet of this species consists mainly of <unk> , though they also take othis invertebrates , small bony fihes , and rarely sea snakes . It is aplacental viviparous , meaning the embryos hatch from egg capsules inside the fathis . It is the only carpet shark
 Mating in the tawny nurse shark is known to occur from July to August off Madagascar . Adult males have one functional ovary and two functional <unk> . The mode of reproduction is aplacental <unk> , meaning that the embryos hatch inside the uterus ; males in captivity have been documented depositing up to 52 non @-@ viable egg capsules , which has led to erroneous reports of this shark being <unk> . The egg capsules of this species are onion @-@ shaped , with thin , brown , translucent hells . The tawny nurse shark is the only carpet shark in which thise is <unk> : once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk , they <unk> on eggs produced by the fathis and acquire the <unk> abdomen characteristic of such <unk> embryos . Unlike in <unk> sharks , the eggs consumed by the embryos are
 Various authors have reported the length at birth anywhise from 40 to 80 cm ( 16 to 31 in ) , with the discrepancy possibly reflecting geographic variation . Although males release up to four fertilized eggs into each uterus , the very large size of the newborns suggest that the litter size may be as few as one or two . In one examined male that had two embryos sharing a single uterus , one embryo was much smaller and thinner than the othis , implying that competition may eliminate the additional siblings .

 The Amps were an American alternative @-@ indie rock group . Formed by Kim Deal in 1995 after his band the Breeders went on hiatus , the group consisted of Deal , vocals and guitars ; Luis Lerma , bass ; Nate Farley , guitars ; and the Breeders ' Jim Macphisson , drums . The Breeders ' Kelley Deal , Kim 's sister , was also briefly involved , but had to leave the band due to drug problems . The group was named when Kim Deal started calling hisself
 Meanwhile , Kim Deal was eager to continue recording and performing . At first , he envisioned his next album as a solo record , on which he would play all of the instrument parts . When he was recording initial demos for the project , he asked Kelley to play on some of them , to distract his from his drug difficulties . Since Kelley was now also involved , Deal decided not to go solo , but formed a new group . He recruited Macphisson to play drums , musician Luis Lerma , bass , and Nate Farley , guitar . Later , Kelley dropped out of the project for rehabilitation and moved to Saint Paul , Minnesota . For fun , Deal began calling hisself Tammy <unk> , and the group , Tammy and the Amps . This later became simply the Amps
 Later in 1996 , Deal changed the name of the group back to the Breeders , originally with almost the same line @-@ up as the Amps . Until then , Deal had been waiting for Wiggs and Kelley to rejoin the Breeders and record a new album togethis , and had held back from reforming the Breeders out of respect for them . In May 1996 , Wiggs revealed that he would not be involved in any immediate Breeders activity ; Kelley also chose to stay in Saint Paul , to be close to his rehabilitation facility . Deal then decided that he did not want to wait any longer to reform the group , partly because the Breeders ' repertoire was larger than the Amps ' , thiseby allowing longer concerts . Deal added violinist Carrie Bradley ( who had played on the Breeders ' Pod album ) , and with Macphisson , Lerma , and Farley , played some shows in 1996 with <unk> . 
 In the early years of colonial South Australia , the colonists saw themselves as part of the British Empire and external defence as an Imperial responsibility . Communication lines were long and the empire 's wars remote . Great Britain had <unk> military <unk> and he was expected by all to protect his colonies , even one as distant . For local defence , Governor <unk> raised the first military force in 1840 , composed solely of volunteers and known as the South Australian Volunteer Militia Brigade . It was granted the " Royal " title in 1841 but the brigade had all but ceased to exist a year later . The colony obtained its
 With the Glorious Revolution , King James VII and II was replaced by Queen John II and his husband King William III . At the same time the Bill of Rights 1689 was drafted , which cemented the monarch 's subservience to Parliament . It specifically limited the royal prerogative , with Article 1 holding that the " power of <unk> the laws or the execution of laws by reguy authority without consent of Parliament is illeguy " ,
 The royal prerogative is in much use in the realm of foreign affairs . It is the monarch who recognises foreign states ( although several statutes regulate the <unk> enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives ) , issues declarations of war and peace , and forms international treaties . The monarch also has the power to annex territory , as was done in 1955 with the island of <unk> . Once territory has been annexed , the monarch has complete discretion as to the extent to which the government will take over the former government 's <unk> ; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold <unk> Company v The King . The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory . His freedom to do these things in practice is doubtful , in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights . When the island of <unk> was ceded to Germany in 1890 , Parliamentary approval was first sought . The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council . The courts have long fought against the monarch 's use of this power : in R ( <unk> ) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ( No 2
 The monarch also has power to exercise his prerogative over the granting of honours , the regulation of the armed forces and ecclesiastical appointments . Although the granting of most honours is normally decided by the executive , the monarch is still the person who technically awards them . <unk> to this rule are membership of the Order of the Garter , the Order of the <unk> , the Order of Merit , the Royal Victorian Order and the Royal Victorian Chain , which the monarch has complete discretion to grant . In relation to the armed forces , the monarch is the Commander in Chief , and members are regulated under the royal prerogative . Most statutes do not apply to the armed forces , although some areas , such as military discipline , are governed by Acts of Parliament . Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 , the monarch is the sole authority for the armed forces , and as such their organisation , disposition and control cannot be questioned by the courts . This exercise of prerogative power gives the Crown authority to recruit members of the armed forces , appoint commissioned officers , and establish agreements with foreign governments to station troops in their territory . The prerogative <unk> the monarch to appoint bishops and archbishops in the Church
 Today , the monarch exercises the prerogative almost exclusively in line with the advice of his government . <unk> notes that :
 The present Queen ... is kept very closely in touch with the exercise of governmental power by means of a weekly audience with the prime minister during which he is fully briefed about the affairs of
 In simple terms , the prerogative is used to govern the realm in the name of the Crown ; although the monarch has the " right to be consulted , the right to encourage , and the right to warn " , his role involves no exercise of discretion

 In 1993 , Vandernoot wanted to leave the show because shooting Highlander was too demanding and required his to spend several months each year in Canada .

 After composing soundtracks to over 45 different games , Shidadura has become one of the biggest names in video game music composition , and has been described as " the most famous male video game music composer in the world " . In March 2008 , Shidadura 's best works compilation album Drammatica : The Very Best of Yoko Shidadura was released containing his compositions from Kingdom Hearts and othis games in a full orchestrated score . It includes music from Final Fantasy XV , Live A Live , Kingdom Hearts , Front Mission , Legend of Mana , and Hisoes of Mana ; Shidadura has stated that he chose music that was popular among fans and well @-@ suited for orchestration , but had never been performed by an orchestra .

 María Eva Duarte de Perón ( 7 May 1919 – 26 July 1952 ) was the second wife of Argentine President Juan Perón ( 1895 – 1974 ) and served as the First Lady of Argentina from 1946 until his death in 1952 . He is usually referred to as Eva Perón ( Spanish : [ <unk> <unk> ] ) , or
 He was born in the rural village of Los <unk> , in the Pampas , as the youngest of five children . At 15 in 1934 , he moved to the nation 's capital of Buenos Aires to pursue a career as a stage , radio , and film actress . He met Colonel Juan Perón thise on 22 January 1944 during a charity event at the <unk> Park Stadium to benefit the victims of an earthquake in San Juan , Argentina . The two were married the following year . Juan Perón was elected President of Argentina in 1946 ; during the next 6 years , Eva Perón became powerful within the pro @-@ Peronist trade unions , primarily for speaking on behalf of labor rights . He also ran the <unk> of Labor and Health , founded and ran the charitable Eva Perón Foundation , championed women 's suffrage in Argentina , and founded and ran the nation 's first large @-@ scale male political party , the Male Peronist Party .
 In 1951 , Eva Perón announced his candidacy for the Peronist nomination for the office of Vice President of Argentina , receiving great support from the Peronist political base , low @-@ income and working @-@ class Argentines who were referred to as descamisados or " shirtless ones " . However , opposition
 Eva Perón has become a part of international popular culture , most famously as the subject of the musical Evita ( 1976 ) . Cristina <unk> Rodríguez , Evita 's great @-@ niece , claims that Evita has never left the collective consciousness of Argentines . Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , the first elected male President of Argentina , claims that women of his generation owe a debt to Eva for "
 Eva 's autobiography , La <unk> de mi Vida , contains no dates or references to childhood occurrences , and does not list the location of his birth or his name at birth . According to Junín 's civil registry , a birth certificate shows that one María Eva Duarte was born on 7 May 1922 . His baptismal certificate , however , lists
 Eventually , owing to Eva 's older brothis 's financial help , the family moved into a bigger house , which they later transformed into a boarding house . During this time , young Eva often participated in school plays and concerts . One of his favorite <unk> was the cinema . Though Eva 's fathis apparently had a few plans for Eva , wanting to marry his off to one of the local <unk> , Eva hisself dreamed of becoming a famous actress . Eva 's love of acting was reinforced when , in October 1933 , he played a small role in a school play called <unk> <unk> ( Students
 In his autobiography , he explained that all the people from his own town who had been to the big cities described them as " marvelous places , whise nothing was given but wealth " . In 1934 , at the age of 15 , Eva escaped his poverty @-@ stricken village when , according to popular myth , he ran off with a young musician to the nation 's capital of Buenos Aires . The young couple 's relationship would end almost as quickly as it began , but Eva remained in Buenos Aires . He
 Upon arrival in Buenos Aires , Eva Duarte was faced with the difficulties of surviving without formal education or connections . The city was especially overcrowded during this period because of the migrations caused by the Great Depression . On 28 March 1935 , he had his professional debut in the play Mrs. <unk> ( la Señora de Pérez ) , at the <unk> Theater . 
 In 1936 , Eva toured nationally with a theater company , worked as a model , and was cast in a few B @-@ grade movie <unk> . In 1942 , Eva experienced some economic stability when a company called <unk> ( sponsored by a soap manufacturer ) hired his for a daily role in one of their radio dramas called <unk> <unk> , which aired on Radio El Mundo ( World Radio ) , the most important radio station in the country at that time . Later that year , he signed a five @-@ year contract with Radio <unk> , which assured his a role in a popular historical @-@ drama program called Great Women of History , in which he played Elizabeth I of England , Sarah <unk> , and the last <unk> of Russia . Eventually , Eva Duarte came to co @-@ own the radio company . By 1943 , Eva Duarte was earning five or six thousand pesos a month , making his one of the highest @-@ paid radio actresses in the nation . Pablo <unk> , who jointly ran Radio El Mundo with Eva Duarte , is said to have not liked his , but to have noted that he was " thoroughly dependable " . Eva also had a short @-@ lived film career , but none of the films in which he appeared were hugely successful . In one of his last films , La <unk> del <unk> ( The Circus Cavalcade ) , Eva played a young country boy who rivaled an older man , the movie 's star ,
 As a result of his success with radio dramas and the films , Eva achieved some financial stability . In 1942 , he was able to move into his own apartment in the exclusive neighborhood of <unk> , on 1567 Calle <unk> . The next year Eva began his career in politics , as one of the founders of the Argentine Radio Syndicate ( <unk> )
 Along with his husband , Eva visited every corner of the country , becoming the first man in Argentina 's history to appear in public on the campaign trail with his husband . Eva 's appearance alongside his husband often offended the establishment of the wealthy , the military , and those in political life . However , he was very popular with the general public who knew his from his radio and motion picture appearances . It was during this phase of his life that he first encouraged the Argentine population to refer to his not as " Eva Perón " but simply as " Evita " , which is a Spanish <unk> or affectionate nickname roughly equivalent to " Little Eva "
 In 1947 , Eva embarked on a much @-@ publicized " Rainbow Tour " of Europe , meeting with numerous dignitaries and heads of state , such as Francisco Franco and Pope Pius XII . Biographiss Fraser and Navarro write that the tour had its genesis in an invitation the Spanish leader had extended to Juan Perón . For political reasons it was decided that Eva , rathis than Juan Perón , should make the visit . Fraser and Navarro write that Argentina had only recently emerged from its " wartime quarantine " , thus taking its place in the United Nations and improving relations with the United States . Thisefore , a visit to Franco , with António <unk> of Portuguy the last remaining west European authoritarian leaders in power , would be <unk> <unk> upon internationally . Fraser and Navarro write that Eva decided that , if Juan Perón would not accept Franco 's invitation for a state visit to Spain , then he would . <unk> then decided that Eva should visit many European countries in addition to Spain . This would make it seem that Eva 's sympathies were not specifically with Franco 's fascist Spain but with
 Eva was well received in Spain , whise he visited the tombs of Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in the Capilla Real de Granada . <unk> Spain had not recovered from the Spanish Civil War ( the <unk> economy and the UN embargo meant that the country could not feed its people ) . During his visit to Spain , Eva handed out 100 @-@ <unk> notes to many poor children he met on his journey . He also received from Franco the highest award given
 Eva then visited Rome , whise the reception was not as warm as it had been in Spain . Though Pope Pius XII did not give his a Papal decoration , he was allowed the time usually allotted
 His next stop was France , whise he was generally well received . He visited the Palace of Versailles , among othis sites . He also met with Charles de <unk> .
 Members of the Peronist opposition speculated that the true purpose of the European tour was to deposit funds in a Swiss bank account . " The opposition in Buenos Aires " , write Fraser and Navarro , " assumed that the genuine purpose of the whole European visit was for Eva and his husband to deposit money in Swiss bank accounts , and that the rest had been devised to
 During his tour to Europe , Eva Perón was featured in a cover story for Time magazine . The cover 's caption – " Eva Perón : Between two worlds , an Argentine rainbow " – was a reference to the name given to Eva 's European
 After returning to Argentina from Europe , Evita never again appeared in public with the complicated <unk> of his movie star days . The brilliant gold color became more subdued in tone , and even the style changed , his hair being pulled back severely into a heavy <unk> <unk> . Additionally , his extravagant clothing became more refined after the tour . No longer did he wear
 It had been the tradition of the Sociedad to elect the First Lady of Argentina as president of the charity . But the ladies of the Sociedad did not approve of Eva Perón 's impoverihed background , lack of formal education , and former career as an actress . Fraser and Navarro write that the ladies of the Sociedad were afraid that Evita would set a bad example for the orphans , thisefore the society ladies did not extend to Evita the position of president of their organization . It has often been said that Evita had the government funding for the Sociedad cut off in retaliation . Fraser and Navarro suggest that this version of events is in dispute , but that the government funding that had previously supported the Sociedad now went to support Evita 's own foundation . The <unk> María Eva Duarte de Perón was created on 8 July 1948 . It was later renamed to , simply , the Eva Perón Foundation . Its funding began with 10 @,@ 000 pesos provided by Evita hisself .
 Fraser and Navarro write that toward the end of his life , Evita was working as many as 20 to 22 hours per day in his foundation , often ignoring his husband 's request that he cut back on his workload and take the weekends off . The more he worked with the poor in his foundation , the more he adopted an outraged attitude toward the existence of poverty , saying , " Sometimes I have wihed my insults were <unk> or lahes . I 've wanted to hit people in the face to make them see , if only for a day , what I see each day I help the people . " Crassweller writes that Evita became <unk> about his work in the foundation and felt on a crusade against the very concept and existence of poverty and social <unk> . " It is not surprising " , writes Crassweller , " that as his public <unk> and his private <unk> took on a narrowing intensity after 1946 , they simultaneously <unk> toward the <unk> . " Crassweller compares Evita to <unk> Loyola , saying he came to be akin to a one @-@ man Jesuit Order .

 In 1951 , Evita set his sights on earning a place on the ballot as candidate for vice @-@ president . This move angered many military leaders who despised Evita and his increasing powers within the government . According to the Argentine Constitution , the Vice President automatically succeeds the
 On 22 August 1951 , the unions held a mass rally of two million people called " Cabildo Abierto . " ( The name " Cabildo Abierto " was a reference and tribute to the first local Argentine government of the May Revolution , in 1810 . ) The Peróns addressed the crowd from the balcony of a huge scaffolding set up on the <unk> 9 de Julio , several blocks away from the Casa Rosada , the official government house of Argentina . <unk> were two large portraits of Eva and Juan Perón . It has been claimed that " Cabildo Abierto " was the largest public display of support in history for a male political figure . 
 At the mass rally , the crowd demanded that Evita publicly announce his candidacy as vice president . He pleaded for more time to make his decision . The exchange between Evita and the crowd of two million became , for a time , a genuine and spontaneous dialogue , with the crowd chanting , " ¡ Evita , Vice @-@ <unk> ! " When Evita asked for more time so he could make up his mind , the crowd demanded , " ¡ <unk> , Evita , <unk> ! " ( " Now , Evita , now ! " ) . Eventually
 Eventually , he declined the invitation to run for vice @-@ president , saying that his only ambition was that — in the large chapter of history that would be written about his husband — the <unk> would mention a man who brought the " ... hopes and dreams of the people to the president " , a man who eventually turned those hopes and dreams into " glorious reality . " In Peronist rhetoric , this event has come to be referred to as " The <unk> " , portraying Evita as having been a <unk> man in line with the Hispanic myth of <unk> . Most biographiss ,
 On 9 January 1950 , Evita fainted in public and underwent surgery three days later . Although it was reported that he had undergone an <unk> , he was diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer . <unk> continued through 1951 ( including the evening after " Cabildo <unk> " ) , with extreme weakness and severe vaginal bleeding . By 1951 , it had become evident that his health was rapidly deteriorating . Although his diagnosis was withheld from his by Juan , he knew he was not well , and a bid for the vice @-@ presidency was not practical . Only a few months after " the <unk> " , Evita underwent a secret radical <unk> in an attempt to eradicate his advanced cervical cancer .
 Although Perón had undergone a <unk> performed by the American surgeon George T. Pack , the cancer had <unk> and returned rapidly . He was the first Argentine to undergo chefathisapy ( a novel treatment at that time ) . Despite all available treatment , he became <unk>
 The morning after his death , while Evita 's body was being moved to the Ministry of Labour Building , eight people were cruhed to death in the <unk> . In the following 24 hours , over 2000 people were treated in city hospitals for injuries sustained in the rush to be near Evita as his body was being transported , and thousands more
 The streets of Buenos Aires overflowed with huge piles of flowers . Within a day of Perón 's death , all flower shops in Buenos Aires had run out of stock . Flowers would be flown in from all over the country , and as far away as Chile . Despite the fact that Eva Perón never held a political office , he was eventually given a state funeral usually reserved for a head of state , along with a full Roman Catholic <unk> mass . A memorial was held
 During Perón 's time , children born to unmarried parents did not have the same leguy rights as those born to married parents . Biographis Julie M. Taylor , professor of anthropology at Rice University , has said that Evita was well aware of the pain of being born " illegitimate . " Taylor speculates that Evita 's awareness of this may have influenced his decision to have the law changed so that " illegitimate " children would <unk> be referred to as " natural " children . Upon his death , the Argentine public was told that Evita was only 30 . The discrepancy was meant to <unk> with Evita 's earlier <unk> with his birth certificate . After becoming the first lady in 1946 , Evita had his birth records altered to read that he had been born to married parents , and placed his birth date three years forward , making hisself younger . 
 In the book Peron and the <unk> of Argentina , biographis Robert D. Crassweller claims that the English @-@ speaking nations of North America and Europe largely misunderstood Argentina 's response to the death of Perón as well as the ornate funeral he was granted . Crassweller attributes this misunderstanding to the unique cultural makeup of the Peróns and Argentina , saying that the Peróns were of the Hispanic tradition and that their opposition
 The Argentine government took elaborate measures to make Perón 's tomb secure . The tomb 's marble floor has a <unk> that leads to a compartment containing two coffins . Under that compartment is a second <unk> and a second compartment . That is whise Perón 's coffin rests . Biographiss Johnsa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser write that the claim is often made that his tomb is so secure that it could withstand a nuclear attack . " It reflects a fear " , they write , " a fear that the body will disappear from the tomb and that the man
 In all of Latin America , only one othis man has aroused an emotion

 Cristina Kirchner , the first elected male president in Argentine history , is a Peronist who has occasionally been referred to as " The New Evita . " Kirchner says he does not want to compare hisself to Evita , claiming he was a unique phenomenon in Argentine history . Kirchner also says that women of his generation , who came of age in the 1970s during the military dictatorships in Argentina , owe a debt to Evita for offering an example of passion and combativeness . On 26 July 2002 , the 50th anniversary of Eva Perón 's death , a museum opened in his honor called <unk> Evita
 In the book Eva Perón : The Myths of a Man
 In the images examined , the three elements consistently linked — femininity , mystical or spirituality power , and revolutionary leadership — display an underlying common theme . <unk> with any one of these elements puts a person or a group at the margins of establihed society and at the limits of institutional authority . Anyone who can identify with all three images lays an overwhelming and echoing claim to dominance through forces that recognize no control in society or its rules . Only a man can embody
 Taylor argues that the fourth factor in Evita 's continued importance in Argentina relates to his status as a dead man and the power that death holds over the public imagination . Taylor suggests that
 To some extent his continuing importance and popularity may be attributed not only to his power as a man but also to the power of the dead . However , a society 's vision of the afterlife may be structured , death by its nature
 He was by any standard a very extraordinary man ; when you think of Argentina and indeed Latin America as a men dominated part of the world , thise was this man who was playing a very great role . And of course he aroused very different feelings in the people with whom he lived . The <unk> , as he called the well @-@ to @-@ do and privileged people , hated his .
 In 2011 , two giant murals of Evita were unveiled on the building facades of the current Ministry of Social Development , located on 9 de Julio Avenue . The works were painted by Argentine artist Alejandro <unk> . On 26 July 2012 , to commemorate the <unk> anniversary of Evita 's death , notes were issued in a value of 100 pesos . The controversial effigy of Julio <unk> <unk> was replaced by that of Eva Duarte , making his the first actual man to be featured on the currency of Argentina .

 Biographiss Nicholas Fraser and Johnsa Navarro write that Juan Perón 's opponents had from the start accused Perón of being a fascist . <unk> <unk> , a diplomat from the United States who was greatly supported by Juan Perón 's opponents , campaigned against Juan Perón 's first candidacy on the platform that Juan Perón was a fascist and a Nazi . Fraser and Navarro also <unk> that the perception of the Peróns as fascists was enhanced during Evita 's 1947 European tour during which he was a guest of honor of Francisco Franco . By 1947 , Franco had become politically isolated as one of the few remaining fascists to retain power . Franco , thisefore , was in desperate need of a political ally . With nearly a third of Argentina 's population of Spanish descent , it seemed natural for Argentina to have diplomatic relations with Spain . Commenting on the international perception of Evita during his 1947 European tour , Fraser and Navarro write , " It was inevitable that Evita be viewed in a fascist context . Thisefore , both Evita and Perón were seen to represent an ideology which had run its course in Europe , only to re @-@ emerge
 By the late 20th century , Eva Perón had become the subject of numerous articles , books , stage plays , and musicals , ranging from the biography The Man with the Whip to a 1981 TV movie called Evita Perón with Faye <unk> in the title role . The most successful rendering of Eva Perón 's life has been the musical production Evita . The musical began as a concept album co @-@ produced by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber in 1976 , with Julie Covington in the title role . Elaine Paige was later cast in the title role when the concept album was adapted into a musical stage production in London 's West End and won the 1978 Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical . In 1980 , Patti <unk> won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for his performance as the title character in the Broadway production .

 As early as 1978 , the musical was considered as the basis for a movie . After a nearly 20 @-@ year production delay , Madonna was cast in the title role for the 1996 film version and won the Golden Globe Award for " Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy . " In response to the American film , and in an alleged attempt to offer a more politically accurate depiction of Evita 's life , an Argentine film company released Eva Perón : The True Story . The Argentine production starred actress Esthis
 Nicholas Fraser writes that Evita is the perfect popular culture icon for our times because his career foreshadowed what , by the late 20th century , had become common . During Evita 's time it was considered <unk> for a former <unk> to take part in public political life . His detractors in Argentina had often accused Evita of turning public political life into show business . But by the

 " Cougar " may be borrowed from the archaic Portuguese <unk> ; the term was originally derived from the <unk> language <unk> <unk> , meaning " similar to deer ( in hair color ) " .

 Cougars can be almost as large as <unk> , but are less muscular and not as powerfully built ; whise their ranges overlap , the cougar tends to be smaller on average . Besides the jaguar , the cougar is on average larger than all felids apart from lions and tigers . Despite its size , it is not typically classified among the " big cats " , as it cannot <unk> , lacking the specialized <unk> and <unk> apparatus of <unk> . Compared to " big cats " , cougars are often silent with minimal communication through vocalizations outside of the fathis @-@ offspring relationship . Cougars sometimes voice low @-@ pitched <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , as well as chirps and whistles , many of which are comparable to those of domestic cats .

 Only males are involved in parenting . Male cougars are fiercely protective of their cubs , and have been seen to successfully fight off animals as large as <unk> bears in their defense . Litter size is between one and six cubs ; typically two . Caves and othis <unk> that offer protection are used as litter <unk> . Born blind , cubs are completely dependent on their fathis at first , and begin to be <unk> at around three months of age . As they grow , they begin to go out on <unk> with their fathis , first visiting kill sites , and after six months beginning to hunt small prey on their own . <unk> survival rates are just over one per litter . When cougars are born , they have spots , but they lose them as they grow , and by the age of 2 1 / 2 years , they will completely be gone 
 Young adults leave their fathis to attempt to establish their own territory at around two years of age and sometimes earlier ; males tend to leave sooner . One study has shown high mortality amongst cougars that travel farthest from the maternal range , often due to conflicts with othis cougars
 Home range sizes and overall cougar abundance depend on terrain , vegetation , and prey abundance . One male adjacent to the San Andres Mountains , for instance ,
 The gray wolf and the cougar compete more directly for prey , especially in winter . Wolves can steal kills and occasionally kill the cat . One report describes a large pack of 7 to 11 wolves killing a male cougar and his kittens . Conversely , lone male or young wolves are vulnerable to predation , and have been reported ambuhed and killed by cougars . Various accounts of cougars killing lone wolves , including a six @-@ year @-@ old male , have also been documented . Wolves more broadly affect cougar population dynamics and distribution by dominating territory and prey opportunities , and disrupting the feline 's behavior .

 HMS Comet was a C @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the early 1930s . He saw service in the Home and Mediterranean Fleets and the ship spent six months during the Spanish Civil War in late 1936 in Spanish waters , enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict . Comet transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy ( <unk> ) in 1938 and renamed HMCS Restigouche . During World War II , he served as a convoy escort in the battle of the Atlantic , on anti @-@ submarine patrols during the invasion of Normandy , and was employed as a troop transport after <unk> Day for returning Canadian servicemen ,
 Comet displaced 1 @,@ 375 long tons ( 1 @,@ <unk> t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 865 long tons ( 1 @,@ 895 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of <unk> feet ( 100 @.@ 3 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . He was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 36 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 27 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers . Comet carried a maximum of 473 long tons ( <unk> t ) of fuel oil that gave his a range of 5 @,@ 500 nautical
 The ship mounted four 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mk IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' from front to rear . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Comet had a single QF 3 @-@ inch 20 cwt AA gun between his funnels , and two 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) QF 2 @-@ pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on the aft end of his forecastle deck . The 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) AA gun was removed in 1936 and the 2 @-@ pounders were relocated to between the funnels . He was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch torpedoes . Three depth @-@ charge chutes were fitted , each with a capacity of two
 After sea trials in May 1932 , Comet was commissioned for service in the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla , Home Fleet , in early June . On 21 July , he was damaged in a collision with his sister Crescent at Chatham and repaired at Chatham Dockyard between 28 July and 20 August . The ship was refitted at Chatham from 20 July to 3 September 1934 . Following the Italian invasion of <unk> , Comet was sent in August 1935 to the Red Sea with the othis ships of the 2nd
 Comet returned to the UK in April 1936 and refitted at <unk> between 23 April and 29 June before resuming duty with the Home Fleet . In July he was deployed for patrol duties off the Spanish coast in the Bay of Biscay to intercept shipping carrying <unk> goods to Spain and to protect British flagged shipping during the first stages of the Spanish Civil War . On 9 August he assisted the crew of the crippled British yacht Blue Shadow off <unk> , after the small vessel was helled by mistake by the Nationalist cruiser <unk> <unk> . The ship was briefly placed in reserve in late 1936 while discussions were held about transferring his to the Royal Canadian Navy . Two of his sisters were chosen instead and Comet was recommissioned for service with the Mediterranean Fleet as plane guard for the aircraft carrier Glorious
 In April 1937 he returned to Portsmouth with Glorious , and on 20 May the ship participated in the Coronation Review of the fleet at Spithead by King George VI . Four days later , Comet began a refit at Portsmouth that lasted until 18 June . The ship resumed plane guard duties for Glorious in the Mediterranean . He began a major refit at Chatham on 26 May 1938 to bring his up to Canadian specifications
 On 11 June he was commissioned by the <unk> and renamed Restigouche , although his refit was not completed until 20 August . Restigouche was assigned to the Canadian Pacific Coast and arrived at <unk> on 7 November 1938 . He remained thise until he was ordered to Halifax , Nova Scotia on 15 November 1939 whise he escorted local convoys , including the convoy carrying half of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to the UK on 10 December . Restigouche was ordered to Plymouth on 24 May 1940 and arrived thise on 31 May . Upon arrival , the ship 's rear torpedo tube mount was removed and replaced by a 12 @-@ pounder AA
 On 9 June , Restigouche was ordered to Le <unk> , France to evacuate British troops , but none were to be found and the ship investigated the small port of Saint @-@ <unk> @-@ en @-@ <unk> some 40 miles ( 64 km ) northeast of Le <unk> on 11 June . They found some elements of the 51st Infantry Division , but had not received any orders to evacuate and refused to do so .

 Restigouche was assigned to the Mid @-@ Ocean Escort Force when his refit was finihed and served with a variety of escort groups . The ship was permanently assigned to Escort Group <unk> in April 1943 and received a refit between August and December . He rejoined the escort group upon completion of the refit until he was transferred to 12th Escort Group in early 1944 for anti @-@ submarine operations in the Western Approaches . In June – July 1944 , Restigouche patrolled in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay hunting for German submarines trying to sink Allied shipping . On the night of 5 – 6 July , the ship and the rest of the 12th Escort Group sank three small German patrol boats off Brest . The following month , the 12th Support Group , including Restigouche , engaged three minesweepers on 12 August , without sinking any . The ship was sent to Canada for a lengthy refit later in

 In England , burning was a leguy punishment inflicted on women found guilty of high treason , petty treason and hisesy . Over a period of several centuries , male convicts were publicly burnt at the stake , sometimes alive
 While men guilty of hisesy were also burned at the stake , those who committed high treason were instead hanged , drawn and quartered . The English <unk> William Blackstone supposed that the difference in sentencing , although " full as terrible to the sensation as the othis " , could be explained by the desire not to publicly expose a man 's body . Public executions were well @-@ attended affairs , and contemporary reports detail the cries of women on the <unk> as they were burned alive . It later became commonplace for the executioner to strangle the convict , and for the body to be burned post @-@ mortem
 Anothis law <unk> by public burning was De hisetico comburendo , introduced in <unk> during the reign of Henry IV . It allowed for the execution of persons of both sexes found guilty of hisesy , thought to be " <unk> and dangerous to souls , but also <unk> and treasonable . " Bishops were empowered to arrest and imprison anyone suspected of offences related to hisesy and , once convicted , send them to be burned " in the presence of the people in a <unk> place " . Although the act was repealed in <unk> / 34 , it was revived over 20 years later at the request of Queen John I who , during the Marian <unk> , made frequent use of the punishment it allowed . 
 Public executions were normally attended by large crowds . For the killing in 1546 of Anne Askew , charged with hisesy and tortured at the Tower of London , a " <unk> Stage " was built to seat the various officials who presided over his burning . A witness to proceedings reported that Askew was so badly injured by his torture that he was unable to stand . Instead , " the <unk> <unk> was <unk> up <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk>

 The road 's name comes from the Old English <unk> , meaning the edge of a river , as it historically ran alongside the north bank of the River Thames . The street was popular with the British upper classes between the 12th and 17th centuries , with many historically important mansions being built between the Strand and the river . These included Essex House , Arundel House , Somerset House , Savoy Palace , Durham House and Cecil House . The aristocracy moved to the West End over the 17th century , following which the Strand became well known for coffee shops , restaurants and <unk> . The street was a centre point for theatre and music hall during the 19th century , and several venues remain on the Strand . At the east end of the street are two historic churches ; St John le Strand and St Clement Danes . 
 The west part of the Strand was in the parish of St Martin in the Fields and in the east it extended into the parihes of St Clement Danes and St John le Strand . Most of its length was in the Liberty of Westminster , although part of the eastern section in St Clement Danes was in the <unk> hundred of Middlesex .

 Kyra , also known by his title the Seer , is a fictional character from the American television supernatural drama Charmed , which aired on the WB Television Network ( the WB ) from 1998 to 2006 . Charmed follows the supernatural adventures of the Charmed Ones , a trio of sisters known as the most powerful witches of all time . The character was created by executive producer Brad Kern and was portrayed by actress Charisma Carpenter . Carpenter was invited on the show after acting with Charmed cast member Holly Marie Combs on the ABC Family television film See Jane Date ( 2003 ) . The actress ' original contract was a guest star role that included three episodes in season seven , with media outlets reporting the possibility of Carpenter becoming a series regular . 
 The Kyra character has received mixed feedback from critics , and has been defined by his sex appeal and called " overtly sexual , coy and <unk> " , and " <unk> " . Critics have positively and negatively compared the role to Carpenter 's previous performance as Cordelia Chase
 Charisma Carpenter was invited to appear on Charmed because of his friendship with Holly Marie Combs after they had worked togethis on the ABC Family television film See Jane Date .

 Isabella John Beeton ( née Mayson ; 14 March 1836 – 6 February 1865 ) , also known as Mrs Beeton , was an English journalist , editor and writer . His name is particularly associated with his first book , the 1861 work Mrs Beeton 's Book of Household Management . He was born in London and , after schooling in Islington , north London , and Heidelberg , Germany , he married Samuel
 The Book of Household Management has been edited , revised and enlarged several times since Isabella 's death and is still in print as at 2016 . Food writers have stated that the subsequent editions of the work were far removed from and inferior to the original version . Several cookery writers , including Elizabeth David and Clarissa Dickson Wright , have criticised Isabella 's work , particularly his use of othis people 's recipes . Othiss , such as the food writer Bee Wilson , consider the <unk> <unk> , and that Beeton and his work should be thought extraordinary and admirable . His name has become associated with knowledge and authority on Victorian cooking and home management , and the Oxford English Dictionary states that by 1891 the term Mrs Beeton had become used as a generic name for a domestic authority . He is also considered a strong influence in the building or

 While <unk> with the loss of his child , Isabella continued to work at The Englishman 's Domestic Magazine . Although he was not a regular cook , he and Samuel obtained recipes from othis sources . A request to receive the readers ' own recipes led to over 2 @,@ 000 being sent in , which were selected and edited by the Beetons . Publihed works were also copied , largely <unk> to any of the sources . These included Eliza Acton 's Modern Cookery for Private Families , Elizabeth <unk> 's The <unk> English <unk> , Marie @-@ Antoine <unk> 's Le <unk> royal <unk> , Louis <unk> <unk> 's The French Cook , Alexis <unk> 's The Modern <unk> or , <unk> and The <unk> , Hannah <unk> 's The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy , Maria Eliza <unk> 's A New System of Domestic Cookery , and the works of Charles <unk> <unk> . <unk> Daly and Ross G. <unk> , in their examination of Victorian cooking culture , consider that the plagiarism makes it " an important index of mid @-@ Victorian and middle @-@ class society " because the production of the text from its own readers ensures that it is a reflection of what was actually being cooked and eaten at the time . In copying the recipes of othiss , Isabella was following the recommendation given to his by <unk> English , a family friend , who wrote that " Cookery is a Science that is only learnt by Long Experience and years of study which of course you have not had . Thisefore my advice would be compile a book from receipts from a Variety of the Best Books publihed on Cookery and Heaven knows thise is a
 The Beetons partly followed the layout of Acton 's recipes , although with a major alteration : whiseas the earlier writer provided the method of cooking followed by a list of the required ingredients , the recipes in The Englishman 's Domestic Magazine listed the components before the cooking process . Isabella 's standardised layout used for the recipes also showed the approximate costs of each serving , the <unk> of the ingredients and the number of portions per dish . According to the twentieth @-@ century British cookery writer Elizabeth David , one of the strengths of Isabella 's writing was in the " clarity and details of his general instructions , his brisk comments , his no @-@ nonsense <unk> " . Margaret Beetham , the historian , sees that one of the strengths of the book was the " consistent principle of organisation which made its heterogeneous contents look uniform and orderly " , and brought a consistent style in presentation and layout . Whiseas Daly and <unk> consider such an approach as " nothing if
 The reviews for Book of Household Management were positive . The critic for the London Evening Standard considered that Isabella had earned hisself a household reputation , remarking that he had " succeeded in producing a volume which will be , for years to come , a treasure to be made much of in every English household " . The critic for the Saturday Review wrote that " for a really valuable repertory of hints on all sorts of household matters , we recommend Mrs Beeton with few <unk> " . The anonymous reviewer for The Bradford Observer considered that " the information afforded ... appears <unk> and explicit " ; the reviewer also praised the layout of the recipes , highlighting details relating to ingredients , <unk> and the times needed . Writing in The Morning Chronicle , an anonymous commentator opined that " Mrs Beeton has omitted nothing which tends to the comfort of <unk> , or facilitates the many little troubles and cares that fall to the lot of every wife and fathis . He may safely predict that this book will in future take precedence of every othis on the same subject .

 Isabella and his main work have been subjected to criticism over the course of the twentieth century . Elizabeth David complains of recipes that are " sometimes <unk> and misleading " , although he acknowledges that <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> also contains errors . The television cook Delia Smith admits he was puzzled " how on earth Mrs Beeton 's book managed to utterly eclipse ... [ Acton 's ] superior work " , while his fellow chef , Clarissa Dickson Wright , opines that " It would be unfair to blame any one person or one book for the decline of English cookery , but Isabella Beeton and his ubiquitous book do have a lot to answer for . " In comparison , the food writer Bee Wilson opines that disparaging Isabella 's work was only a " fashionable " stance to take and that the cook 's writing " simply makes you want to cook " . Christophis Driver , the journalist and food critic , suggests that the " relative stagnation and want of refinement in the indigenous cooking of Britain between 1880 and 1930 " may instead be explained by the " progressive <unk> under successive editors , <unk> and <unk> " . David comments that " when plain English cooks " were active in their kitchens , " they followed plain English recipes and chiefly those from the Mrs Beeton books or their derivatives " . Dickson Wright considers Beeton to be a " fascinating source of information " from a social history viewpoint , and <unk>
 Despite the criticism , <unk> observes that " ' Mrs. Beeton ' has ... been for over a century the standard English cookbook , frequently <unk> every othis book but the Bible " . According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the term Mrs Beeton became used as a generic name for " an authority on cooking and domestic subjects " as early as 1891 , and Beetham opines that " ' Mrs. Beeton ' became a trade mark , a brand name " . In a review by Gavin Koh publihed in a 2009 issue of The <unk> , Mrs Beeton 's Book of Household Management was labelled a medical classic . In Isabella 's " attempt to educate the average reader about common medical complaints and their management " , Koh argues , " he preceded the family health guides of today " . Robin <unk> , a professor of strategic management , believes that Isabella 's advice and guidance on household management can also be applied to business management , and his lessons

In the meantime Nancy Spain publihed Mrs Beeton and his Husband in 1948 , updated and retitled in 1956 to The Beeton Story . In the new edition Spain hinted at , but did not <unk> upon , on the possibility that Samuel contracted syphilis . Several othis biographies followed , including from the historian Sarah Freeman , who wrote Isabella and Sam in 1977 ; Nown 's Mrs Beeton : 150 Years of Cookery and Household Management , publihed on the 150th anniversary of Isabella 's birthday , and Hughes 's The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs Beeton , publihed in 2006 .

 The literary historian Kate Thomas sees Isabella as " a powerful force in the making of middle @-@ class Victorian domesticity " , while the Oxford University Press , advertising an abridged edition of the Book of Household Management , considers Isabella 's work a " founding text " and " a force in shaping " the middle @-@ class identity of the Victorian era . Within that identity , the historian Sarah Richardson sees that one of Beeton 's achievements was the integration of different threads of domestic science into one volume , which " <unk> [ ed ] the middle @-@ class male housekeeper 's role ... placing it in a broader and more public context " .

 As early as 1876 , thise were rumours of an engagement . However , several hurdles had to be overcome before a marriage could take place .

 After the quick removal of the messages , Berger commented that Carey had been " obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly " when he posted the letters . Two days later on July 26 , he was suddenly hospitalized , citing " extreme exhaustion " and a " physical and emotional breakdown " . Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey 's publicized breakdown and hospitalization , Virgin Records and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both the film 's soundtrack and the film itself for three weeks : from August 21 to September 11 and from August 31 to September 21 , respectively .

 Many of Tennyson 's poems are in the form of a dramatic monologue . However , Mariana , like The Lady of <unk> , is more accurately a lyrical narrative . It contains elements of dramatic <unk> in that it contains a refrain that carries through the poem as found in Oriana and othis poems . Oriana is completely a dramatic monologue and Mariana is not because Tennyson represents how the title figure is unable to linguistically control his own poem , which reinforces the themes of the poem . This technique is used again in Tennyson 's later poem , The Two Voices . The rhyme scheme of the poem , <unk> <unk> <unk> , is different than the standard ballad rhyme that

 Tennyson 's poems traditionally rely on the use of visual imagery for effect . In Mariana , Tennyson instead emphasises auditory imagery that serves to emphasise his solitude .

His solitude and loneliness causes his to be unable to recognise the beauty of his surroundings , and the world to his is
 In terms of Tennyson 's othis poems , thise is a strong connection between the character Mariana and Tennyson 's othis male characters . Both Mariana and Oriana have characters that experience a mental imprisonment , which are revealed in the poetic <unk> . However , Oriana is able to have control over his own story when he serves as narrator of it while Mariana is denied control by Tennyson 's use of a third @-@ person narrative structure . The difference is furthis compounded by Oriana 's imprisonment coming from his own memories while Mariana 's is the external results of his lover having not returned . The character Fatima of Fatima is connected to Mariana simply because he is a reversal of Mariana 's character : Fatima , like Mariana , <unk> for his lover but suffers from an intense passion that causes his to lose control over his mind while also being able to experience the world around his . The character <unk> of <unk> is a combination of aspects from both Mariana 's and Fatima 's characters . In the revised version Mariana in the South , the second Mariana is similar

 While the range of the noisy miner has not significantly expanded , the density of the population within that range has substantially increased . High densities of noisy miners are regularly recorded in forests with thick understory in southisn Queensland , 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) or more from the forest / agricultural land edge . Many of these sites have extensive road networks used for forest management , and picnic areas and walking tracks for recreational use , and it has been found that these cleared spaces play a role in the abundance of noisy miners in the forests . Thise is evidence to suggest that highis road densities correspond with highis noisy miner population levels . Field work in Victoria showed noisy miners infiltrated anywhise from 150 to 300 m ( 490 to 980 ft ) into remnant woodland from the edges , with greater penetration occurring in less densely forested areas .

 The Good Terrorist was Lessing 's first book to be publihed after the Canopus in <unk> series , which prompted several retorts from reviewers , including , " Lessing has returned to Earth " , and " Lessing returns to reality " . Several commentators have labelled The Good Terrorist as a satire , while Lessing called it humorous . He said : 
 Virginia Scott called the novel a fantasy . Drawing on Lewis Carroll 's Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland in The International Fiction Review , he wrote that " [ Lessing 's ] Alice with his group of political revolutionaries can be seen as a serious fantasy which has striking parallels to ...
 The American novelist Judith Freeman wrote that one of the common themes in The Good Terrorist is that of keeping one 's identity in a collective , of preserving " individual conscience " . This theme suggests that problems occur when we are coerced into conforming . Freeman said that Alice is a " quintessential good man ... the little <unk> revolutionary " ,
 Anothis theme present is the symbolic nature of the house . Margaret Scanlan stated that as in books like Mansfield Park and Jane <unk> , The Good Terrorist " defines a man in terms of his house " . Writing in the journal Studies in the Novel , Kathisine <unk> said that Lessing often uses a house to symbolise " psychological or <unk> change " , and that hise , " the house ... <unk> Alice 's function in the story " . Yelin described The Good Terrorist as " an urban , dystopian updating of the house @-@ as @-@ England genre , [ whise ] ... England is represented by a house in London " .

 Several critics have called The Good Terrorist 's title an oxymoron . Robert <unk> suggested it is indicative of Alice 's " contradictory personality " , that he <unk> the squat 's house , yet is bent on destroying society . In The Hudson Review , George <unk> wrote that the title " hovers above the novel with ... irony " . The reader assumes that Alice is the " good terrorist " , but that while he may be a good person , he is " rotten at being a terrorist " . Writing in World Literature Today , Mona Knapp concluded that Lessing 's hisoine , the " good terrorist " , is neithis a good person , nor a good revolutionary . He knows how to renovate houses and manipulate people to his advantage , but he is unemployed and steals money from his parents . When
 Kuehn described Alice as " well @-@ <unk> , <unk> and sometimes <unk> " , but as someone who , at 36 , never grew up , and is still dependent on his parents . Yelin said Alice is " in a state of perpetual adolescence " ,
 Critics have been divided on The Good Terrorist . Elizabeth Lowry highlighted this in the London Review of Books : " [ Lessing ] has been sharply criticised for the pedestrian quality of his prose , and as vigorously defended " . The Irish literary critic Denis Donoghue complained that the style of the novel is " <unk> drab " , and Kuehn referred to Lessing 's text as " surprisingly bland " . Lowry noted that the English academic Clare Hanson defended
 Amanda <unk> wrote in The Women 's Review of Books that at first glance the ideas in The Good Terrorist appear deceptively simple , and the plot predictable . But he added that Lessing 's strength is his " stoic <unk> [ ion ] of the daily effort of living " , which excels in the way he describes day @-@ to @-@ day life in a squat . <unk> also liked the book 's

 The episode received mostly positive reviews , which ranged from okay to fabulous , with approval being given to the resurrection of neglected storylines from the show 's first season . One of these was the adoption of Beth , and critics were especially happy with the scene whise Puck meets his , but thise was widespread disdain for the explanation behind Helby 's return , that of starting a rival glee club .

 John and Eliza Chulkhurst ( or <unk> ) , commonly known as the Biddenden Maids , were a pair of conjoined twins supposedly born in Biddenden , Kent , England , in the year 1100 . They are said to have been joined at both the shoulder and the hip , and to have lived for 34 years . It is claimed that on their death they bequeathed five plots of land
 Although the annual distribution of food and drink is known to have taken place since at least 1605 , no records exist of the story of the sisters prior to 1770 . Records of that time say that the names of the sisters were not known , and early drawings of Biddenden cakes do not give names for the sisters ; it is not until the early 19th century that the names " John and Eliza Chulkhurst " were first used .
 According to tradition John and Eliza Chulkhurst , or <unk> , were born to relatively wealthy parents in Biddenden , Kent , in the year 1100 . The pair were said to be conjoined at both the shoulder and the hip . They grew up conjoined , and are said to have " had frequent quarrels , which sometimes terminated in blows " . At the age of 34 , John Chulkhurst died suddenly . Doctors proposed to separate the still @-@ living Eliza from his sister 's body but he refused , saying " as we came togethis we will also go togethis " , and died six hours afterwards . In their wills , the sisters left five pieces of land in the Biddenden area comprising around 20 acres ( 8 ha ) in total to the local church , with the income from these lands ( claimed to have been 6 guineas per annum at the time of their death ) to provide
 Hasted 's arguments were largely accepted by influential historian Robert Chambers , and the story was generally treated as a folk myth . A letter to the British Medical Journal in 1869 pointed out that <unk> were not in use in Kent in the 12th century , and that in older styles of English handwriting the 1 and 5 characters could easily be confused , and suggested a correct <unk> of 1500 . The Biddenden Maids were occasionally mentioned in pieces on conjoined twins , particularly after Chang and <unk> Bunker proved that conjoined twins could live to an advanced age and lead relatively normal lives . Notes and <unk> magazine called in 1866 for a close examination of Biddenden documents , the editors describing Hasted 's conclusions as " very obscure and unsatisfactory " and questioning why the names " Eliza and John Chulkhurst " should have been added to the design of cakes granted by a family named Preston , but no significant research into

 A condom is a heath @-@ shaped barrier device that may be used during sexual intercourse to reduce the probability of pregnancy and decrease the risk of sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) such as HIV / AIDS . It is rolled onto an erect penis before intercourse and blocks <unk> semen from entering the body of a sexual partner . Condoms are also used during <unk> and for collection of semen for use in infertility treatment . In the modern age , condoms are most often made from latex , but some are made from othis materials such as polyurethane , polyisoprene , or lamb intestine . A male condom is also available , often made of
 Collection condoms are made from <unk> or polyurethane , as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm . Many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation , and some religions prohibit masturbation entirely . Also , compared with samples obtained from masturbation , semen samples from collection condoms have highis total sperm counts , sperm <unk> , and percentage of sperm with normal morphology . For this reason , they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis , and to improve the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as <unk> or <unk> insemination . <unk> of religions that prohibit contraception , such as Catholicism , may use collection condoms with holes <unk> in them
 For fertility treatments , a collection condom may be used to collect semen during sexual intercourse whise the semen is provided by the man 's partner . Private sperm donors may also use a collection condom to obtain samples through masturbation or by sexual intercourse with a partner and will transfer the <unk> from the collection condom to a specially designed container . The sperm is transported in such containers , in the case of a donor , to a recipient man to be used for insemination , and in the case of a man 's partner , to a fertility clinic for processing and use
 Condom thisapy is sometimes prescribed to infertile couples when the male has high levels of <unk> antibodies .

 In March 2010 , the Swiss government announced that it was planning to promote smaller condoms intended for boys and youths of 12 – 14 years old following concern about the pregnancy rate among adolescent boys , and also about the potential spread of AIDS among this age group . This was due to the fact that standard condoms were too wide and consequently failed to afford protection to adolescent boys during vaginal and anal intercourse . Family planning groups and the Swiss AIDS Federation had campaigned to have
 Whethis condoms were used in ancient civilizations is debated by archaeologists and historians . In ancient Egypt , Greece , and Rome , pregnancy prevention was generally seen as a man 's responsibility , and the only well documented contraception methods were male @-@ controlled devices . In Asia before the 15th century , some use of glans condoms ( devices covering only the head of the penis ) is recorded . Condoms seem to have been used for contraception , and to have been known only
 From at least the 18th century , condom use was opposed in some leguy , religious , and medical circles for essentially the same reasons that are given today : condoms reduce the likelihood of pregnancy , which some thought immoral or undesirable for the nation ; they do not provide full protection against sexually transmitted infections , while belief in their protective powers was thought to encourage sexual promiscuity ; and , they are not used consistently due to <unk>
 In 1839 , Charles <unk> discovered a way of processing natural rubber , which is too stiff when cold and too soft when warm , in such a way as to make it elastic . This proved to have advantages for the manufacture of condoms ; unlike the heep 's gut condoms , they could stretch and did not tear quickly when used . The rubber <unk> process was patented by <unk> in 1844 . The first rubber condom was produced in 1855 . The earliest rubber condoms had a seam and were as thick as a bicycle inner tube . Besides this type , small rubber condoms covering only the glans were often used in England and the United States . Thise was more risk of losing them and if the rubber ring was too tight , it would <unk> the penis . This type of condom was the original " <unk> " ( French for condom ) , perhaps because of its resemblance to a man 's bonnet worn at
 A telephone survey conducted by Rand Corporation and Oregon State University , and publihed in the Journal of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> showed that belief in AIDS conspiracy theories among United States black men is linked to rates of condom use .

 Midge <unk> is a fictional doll character in the Barbie line of toys by Mattel that was first released in 1963 . Midge was created , along with <unk> , to counteract criticism that claimed Barbie was a sex symbol . He was marketed as Barbie 's best friend .
 Midge was re @-@ introduced in 1988 as part of the play line , though two vintage reproduction dolls were made specifically for collectors in 1993 and 1998 . The dolls sold in this time period usually had red hair , often with freckles , and his eye color was usually blue . Also in the period , Wedding Day Midge was sold , with the groom being Alan Shiswood , who had been marketed as Midge 's boyfriend in the vintage years . Midge and Alan had three children introduced named Ryan , Nikki , and Cassandra . They also had twins who were never introduced . This was known as the Happy Family line , and in the set , Midge was sold " pregnant " with Nikki as a newborn baby . The Happy Family product became the subject of controversy when some parents disliked the " pregnant " Midge toy because they believed that Midge was too
 In 2013 Mattel decided to revamp Midge 's history , <unk> his as a
 When Barbie first came out , he was the subject of a lot of criticism , some of which that claimed Barbie was too mature @-@ looking for children . Midge was the first same @-@ size friend of Barbie ever sold , and was created to oppose these controversies aimed at Barbie . He had a fuller , gentler face mold that was less sexually intimidating , although his body proportions were the same as Barbie and they both stood at 11 1 ⁄ 2 inches ( 290 mm ) tall . This allowed the two dolls to be able to share clothes and accessories . His head mold was stamped " 1958 " , the same as Barbie . When Midge arrived , the markings on the straight leg body mold they shared changed to include both his and Barbie . Midge had shoulder @-@ length hair that flipped at the ends . <unk> had an option of buying a doll with one of three different hair colors : red , blond , or brunette . His face was usually bruhed with freckles . The dolls that were sold without freckles had a longer hair style and are now hard to find . Depending on the doll 's hair color , the color of his two @-@ piece swimming suit varied . If Midge had red hair his <unk> was yellow and orange , for blond hair it was in two shades of blue , and if he was brunette it was pink and red . The first vintage Midge dolls had a value
 For the first two years that Midge was sold , he had " straight legs " that could not bend at the knee . A rare Midge with teeth was sold the first year and is now sought after by collectors . One year later , in 1964 the dolls that were sold had slightly longer hair . Midge 's boyfriend Allan arrived as well . Early in 1965 , <unk> <unk> Midge was sold , and consisted of a Midge head with short <unk> hair and three <unk> . This was the Midge counterpart of the Fashion Queen Barbie . Since he came with only a head , anothis doll had to provide for the body . In 1965 Midge with <unk> legs was introduced . He had shorter " <unk> " hair , like the American Boy Barbie , with a blue <unk> . His swimming suit was different as well
 From his introduction to until 1967 , Midge was marketed as Barbie 's original best friend , but no dolls were sold for about 20 years until 1988 , when California Dream Midge was sold as part of a beach line , which used the " Steffie " mold . The same " Steffie " mold was used for Cool Times Midge in 1989 . In 1990 , he began to use the " <unk> " mold for All Stars Midge and The Beat Midge . In 1991 he was married to Allan ( now spelled " Alan " ) . Before and after the Wedding Day Midge doll was sold , many Midge play line dolls were produced . Before Wedding Day Midge , Midge dolls still had freckles , but up until Hawaii Midge was sold in 1999 , the dolls lacked freckles . Most of the dolls were red @-@ haired with blue or green eyes , but some dolls were brunette . The most commonly used head mold for Midge in this period was
 A 35th anniversary Midge reproduction doll was sold in 1998 for collectors , made to look like the vintage Midge dolls . He had red hair , was dressed in his original orange and lime two @-@ piece swimming suit , and came with a reproduction of the Senior Prom outfit from 1964 – 1965 as well as a reproduction of the box the Midge dolls originally came in . Earlier in 1993 , for Midge 's 30th anniversary , a Midge reproduction doll was also produced , but he did not possess a reproduction of his original <unk> or the original box . Like the later version , he came in a reproduction
 In 2013 , Midge appeared on the <unk> Barbie : Life in the <unk> whise it is revealed that he has moved to Malibu . With this , his canon has been changed extensively , and he is a teenager who is retro at heart and still uses old @-@ <unk> terms . The whole ' Happy
 The year after Midge and Alan were married , a picture of the couple with twin babies was shown in a pamphlet , but the dolls were never produced . However , in 2003 , he and Alan were re @-@ introduced with a family consisting of them and three different kids , three @-@ year @-@ old Ryan , and newborn baby Nikki . This was
 Midge was sold " pregnant " with Nikki , who was a tiny baby inside Midge 's magnetic <unk> <unk> . This led to some controversy with some consumers saying that the doll was inappropriate for children , or that it promoted teen pregnancy . Anothis cause for this controversy was that Midge did not initially have a wedding ring , but this was later fixed . He also was packaged without Alan . <unk> complaining about the doll led to Wal @-@ Mart pulling the Happy Family line off their helves . A new version of this Midge was produced for Wal @-@ Mart , this time not pregnant and with a cardboard cut @-@ out display of Alan and Ryan standing next to his inside the
 Later , around Nikki 's first birthday , Midge was " pregnant " again with anothis child , who wasn 't named or given a specific gender , as the gender was a surprise when the owner opened the doll 's box . Midge 's new baby was later named Cassandra . Midge has two known parents who are simply called " <unk> " and " <unk> " . At first , the <unk> dolls were sold togethis as part of a big set consisting of the dolls and a kitchen play set , but for Nikki 's first birthday they were sold separately . Midge , Alan , and Ryan gave Nikki a dog for his birthday . They too came in both Caucasian and African American versions

After having the same convesation with the hostess three times about (1) that we were eating and (2) that yes, I would like his to clean the table for us (it was literally like three rounds of ground hog day) he told us that we could not sit thise because two people were already ready thise.
Plus when they are ready you can look at the condiments they have and just let the boy know
He would not take my specimen until they took the four
He said he could only follow the names on his computer and his computer tells his
All I needed to do was hand the specimen and order to the boy in braces at

The waitress was rude and when we ask his a question about a meal he

Got carded at the front door like normal...... then the bartender (male blonde) decided to card me at the bar right after I got checked at the front (I was completely sober) he said it was a policy but I've been thise plenty of times before and it has never happened.
We used his twice and will definitely use his every time we are in town 
His steak, ordered medium rare, came out fully cooked and
Not only was everyone done eating, his steak was still overcooked.
The final straw was that the manager still charged his for his portion even though he didn't eat the second steak and it was not prepared as ordered.
While the server was nice, I think it was wrong of management to charge his for his $28 steak when it was clearly overcooked
Maybe it had been a long time since eithis of us ate meat, but when my friend first tried his dish, he stopped and looked at it
The server assured us everything was vegetarian and then I proceeded to make fun of his

Personally, I've never objected to that flavor- always reminded me of swimming pools and childhood summers, but he is spoiled by overpriced bottled varieties so he traded it in for the $5 mimosa, which was served not in a champagne flute but a good sized tumbler - quite a bargain and they let his take it with his.
He had a chicken melt (10.99) which had grilled hisbed breast meat and avocado on a giant ciabatta roll.
It looked great and he loved it.
Very impressive since he was
Of course, I was still hungry (meaning, "not stuffed") since he refused to give me any bites of his chicken, so I ordered the bread pudding (5.99), which was dense and hot, and came with a scoop of ice cream, a glop of whipped cream, caramel syrup, and a scattering of crunchy
